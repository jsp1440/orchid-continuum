 },
 {
 "Title":"Consciousness and Plant Signaling",
 "Question":"Do plants have consciousness or intelligence?",
 "Answer":"Plants exhibit complex signaling, memory-like behaviors, and environmental responsiveness through biochemical and electrical pathways. While not conscious in the human sense, ongoing research explores plant neurobiology and the potential for a non-neural form of awareness.",
 "Category":"Consciousness & Plant Intelligence",
 "Article":null
 },
 {
 "Title":"Photosynthesis in Orchids",
 "Question":"How does photosynthesis work in orchids?",
 "Answer":"Most orchids use C3 photosynthesis, but many epiphytic orchids use CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism), which allows them to conserve water by opening stomata at night. This adaptation is key in warm, dry, or fluctuating environments.",
 "Category":"Plant Physiology",
 "Article":null
 },
 {
 "Title":"Circadian Rhythms in Orchids",
 "Question":"Do orchids have circadian rhythms?",
 "Answer":"Yes, orchids have internal biological clocks that regulate daily cycles such as flower opening, scent release, and photosynthesis. These rhythms align with light and temperature changes in their environment.",
 "Category":"Plant Physiology",
 "Article":null
 },
 {
 "Title":"Quantum Coherence in Photosynthesis",
 "Question":"What role does quantum coherence play in photosynthesis?",
 "Answer":"Quantum coherence may allow excitons (energy packets) in plant light-harvesting complexes to explore multiple energy pathways simultaneously, selecting the most efficient route to reaction centersâ€”boosting photosynthetic efficiency.",
