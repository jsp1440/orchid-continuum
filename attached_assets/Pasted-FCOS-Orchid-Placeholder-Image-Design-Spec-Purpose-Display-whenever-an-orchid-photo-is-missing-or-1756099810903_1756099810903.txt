FCOS Orchid Placeholder Image — Design Spec

Purpose:
Display whenever an orchid photo is missing or fails to load. Must blend with FCOS brand, be recognizable as orchid-related, and never look like a broken error.

⸻

1. Base Design
    •    Background color: FCOS brand lavender/purple gradient
    •    Hex suggestion: #C5A3D0 → #7A4B8E vertical gradient
    •    Center icon: stylized orchid flower silhouette (not generic flower)
    •    White outline or subtle glow
    •    5 petals + central lip (Cattleya-style shape, clean & iconic)
    •    Border: rounded rectangle (matches your card style)
    •    Aspect ratios: generate 3 versions (1:1 square, 4:3 rectangle, 16:9 wide) for galleries, stats, and hero cards.

⸻

2. Branding Elements
    •    Logo integration:
    •    Bottom-right corner → small FCOS circular logo watermark (semi-transparent white, 40% opacity).
    •    Ensures every placeholder reinforces brand identity.
    •    Optional text overlay:
    •    Centered small text: “Photo Coming Soon” in FCOS font (or clean sans-serif).
    •    Text in white, shadowed for legibility.

⸻

3. Usage Rules
    •    Placeholder should always load instantly if real image fails.
    •    Fade in (crossfade) when actual photo becomes available.
    •    Never repeat “broken” icons → placeholder must look intentional, like part of the design.

⸻

4. Example Variations
    •    General Gallery Placeholder (square, 1:1): orchid silhouette only.
    •    Featured Orchids Placeholder (wider 4:3): silhouette + “Photo Coming Soon.”
    •    Hero Orchid Placeholder (16:9): full lavender gradient background + centered orchid outline, faint logo watermark.

⸻

5. Accessibility
    •    All placeholders carry alt text:
“Placeholder image — orchid photo coming soon.”
    •    Screen readers won’t announce it as broken.

📋 Prompt for Famous AI (to generate + implement)

“Replace all broken/missing photo icons with a branded FCOS placeholder. Use a lavender-to-purple gradient background (#C5A3D0 → #7A4B8E), with a centered white orchid silhouette. Add a subtle semi-transparent FCOS logo watermark in the bottom-right corner. Include text ‘Photo Coming Soon’ for larger featured cards, but not for small thumbnails. Provide 3 aspect ratio variants (1:1, 4:3, 16:9). Always load placeholders instantly if photos are missing, with smooth fade when a real photo is loaded. Ensure all placeholders have alt text: ‘Placeholder image — orchid photo coming soon.’”
