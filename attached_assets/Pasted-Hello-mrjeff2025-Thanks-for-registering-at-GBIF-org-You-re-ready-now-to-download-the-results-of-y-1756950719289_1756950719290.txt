Hello mrjeff2025,

Thanks for registering at GBIF.org. You're ready now to download the results of your searches of the hundreds of millions of free and open biodiversity records made available by the GBIF community of participants and publishers.

Next steps

Cite the data you download

The data accessed through GBIF.org represents the work of scientists, researchers, curators, data and IT specialists, and other professionals in hundreds of organizations around the world. When you use the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) assigned to each search result you download, you help ensure that they get full credit for their efforts.

The DOI is included in the confirmation email you receive when your download is ready, and your account profile also maintains a record of all your download DOIs. By citing data in this way, you can simplify the references in your research, ensure your ability to repeat or update search results, and link uses directly to relevant datasets, enabling us to automate the reporting of those uses to publishers and users alike. Want more details?
