Goal: Evaluate whether the Orchid Image Library features would add value to this Orchid Continuum project, and integrate only if beneficial.

Phase 1 - Evaluation & Assessment:

Document current Orchid Continuum capabilities:
What image management features already exist?
How are orchid photos currently stored and organized?
What metadata is already being tracked (genus, species, photographer, etc.)?
Is there existing web scraping for orchid data?
What admin interfaces or tools are available?
How is data currently stored (database, files, APIs)?
Compare with proposed Orchid Image Library features:
Google Sheets integration for metadata storage
Google Drive integration for image hosting
Web scraping from orchidcentral.org and other sites
Automated image processing (resizing, format conversion, EXIF handling)
Metadata enrichment and validation
Status tracking (approved/missing/pending images)
Search and browse capabilities
Streamlit-based admin interface
Gap analysis: Create a detailed report showing:
Features that already exist in Orchid Continuum (no need to add)
Features that are missing and would add value
Features that exist but could be improved with the new implementation
Any potential conflicts or compatibility issues
Recommendation: Based on the analysis, recommend one of:
Skip integration: Orchid Continuum already has equivalent or better functionality
Partial integration: Only add specific missing features that would improve the system
Full integration: The new system would significantly enhance current capabilities
Phase 2 - Integration (Only if recommended):

[Only proceed if Phase 1 recommends integration]

Create reusable library: Set up orchidlib/ with the beneficial modules identified in the gap analysis
Build adapters: Create connection bridges between existing data structures and new features
Implement safely: Add new features with feature flags and read-only testing mode
Test thoroughly: Validate that existing functionality remains intact while new features work correctly
Success Criteria for Phase 1:

Clear documentation of all current image and metadata capabilities
Detailed comparison showing exactly what's missing vs. what already exists
Evidence-based recommendation on whether integration adds value
If integration is recommended, specific list of which features to add
Deliverable: A comprehensive evaluation report that clearly states whether this integration is worth pursuing, and if so, exactly which parts would improve your existing system.
