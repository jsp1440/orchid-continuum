Prompt for AI Developer — Orchid Continuum Homepage Restructure

Objective:
Redesign the homepage layout so it functions as a seamless FCOS member resource widget, not as a separate “society site.” Fix image loading issues, ensure Orchid of the Day is visible above the fold, and streamline the section order.

⸻

BEFORE (Current Issues Noted)
    1.    Hero area
    •    “Ready to Discover Your Orchids?” tagline.
    •    Orchid of the Day card is below the fold → requires scrolling.
    2.    Quick Links row (Browse Gallery, How It Works, Judging Standards, Database Sources).
    •    Too much spacing → pushes content too far down.
    3.    Recent Additions grid
    •    Many broken/missing images (generic “broken camera” icons).
    •    Layout too tall, forces extra scrolling.
    4.    Featured Orchids
    •    Appears below recent additions, inconsistent placement.
    5.    Top Genera in Collection / Collection Statistics
    •    Overly tall blocks.
    •    Too many numbers/cards showing at once.
    6.    Footer
    •    Duplicate branding → makes the widget feel like a separate society.

⸻

AFTER (Target Layout)

🟣 Top of Page (above the fold)
    1.    Orchid of the Day
    •    Full-width card with orchid image, title, and “Learn More” button fully visible without scrolling.
    •    Responsive image scaling → orchid always visible (no cropping off bottom).
    2.    Quick Links Row (directly under Orchid of the Day)
    •    Compact icons: Browse Gallery | How It Works | Judging Standards | Database Sources.
    •    Reduce padding so entire row fits on a single line for desktop.

⸻

🟣 Middle Sections
    3.    Recent Additions (Carousel)
    •    Replace current grid with scrollable horizontal carousel (6–10 thumbnails visible at a time).
    •    Each orchid shows: thumbnail, name, “View” button.
    •    If image missing → branded FCOS orchid placeholder (not broken camera).
    4.    Featured Orchids
    •    Compact horizontal strip, max 3–4 orchids visible.
    •    Should be distinguishable from “Recent Additions” with badge or highlight color.

⸻

🟣 Lower Sections
    5.    Collection Statistics (Compact Cards)
    •    Show fewer stats per row (2–3 max on mobile, 4 on desktop).
    •    Reduce card height so the section fits in half the space.
    •    Examples: Total Records, Genera, Species, Photos Available.
    •    “View More Statistics” → expand button instead of loading everything at once.
    6.    Top Genera (Optional)
    •    Collapse into expandable section (not shown by default).

⸻

🟣 Footer
    7.    FCOS Branding Footer
    •    Replace current standalone footer with:
    •    FCOS logo + text:
“A Digital Resource of the Five Cities Orchid Society”
    •    Quick Links: Cultural Tips | Growing Guide | Contact Us.
    •    Remove duplication so it looks like an FCOS site integration, not a new society.

⸻

IMAGE FIX REQUIREMENTS
    •    All orchid galleries must attempt real photo load first.
    •    If no photo exists → use branded FCOS placeholder (consistent design, no broken icons).
    •    Lazy-load additional images for speed.

⸻

RESPONSIVENESS
    •    Desktop:
    •    Orchid of the Day (hero) takes full width.
    •    Galleries are horizontal carousels.
    •    Tablet/Mobile:
    •    Orchid of the Day scales down but always fully visible.
    •    Quick Links stack neatly (2x2 grid on phones).
    •    Stats/cards fit 2 across max.

Example Instruction to Give AI

“Move Orchid of the Day to the very top, make sure it fits fully on screen without scrolling. Below that, add the Quick Links row. Convert Recent Additions and Featured Orchids into horizontal carousels with branded placeholders for missing images. Make Collection Statistics compact. Replace footer with FCOS branding so it integrates with our Neon One site.”
