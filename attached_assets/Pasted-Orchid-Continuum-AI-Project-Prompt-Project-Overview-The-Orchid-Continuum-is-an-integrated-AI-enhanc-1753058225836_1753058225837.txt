Orchid Continuum AI Project Prompt

Project Overview
The Orchid Continuum is an integrated AI-enhanced orchid database and automation system. It consolidates photo and text data from multiple sources (e.g., internal taxonomy files, user submissions, websites such as Gary Yong Gee’s and Roberta Fox’s), enriches it via OCR and AI metadata extraction, and powers several interactive widgets on the FCOS website including a Member Gallery, Orchid of the Day, and Cultural Info Finder.

Core Objectives
1. Centralize and standardize all orchid photo and text data into a unified folder structure.
2. Automate data ingestion via scraping, user uploads, and legacy form inputs.
3. Use AI + OCR to extract metadata from image labels and embed it in the dataset.
4. Create an always-on scraping agent to keep the database updated with photos + cultural information.
5. Power website widgets that use this data in real time (Orchid of the Day, Weather Widget, etc.).

Folder Structure (Google Drive or Colab)
- /OrchidContinuum_Central
   - /TAXONOMY_MASTER
   - /Orchid_Quick_Images
   - /Legacy_Submissions
   - /Scraped_Content_Gary_Yong_Gee
   - /Scraped_Content_Roberta_Fox
   - /Processed_Metadata
   - /Widget_Outputs

Key Metadata Fields
- Scientific Name
- Genus
- Species
- Author
- Region
- Bloom Time
- Growth Habit (epiphytic, terrestrial, etc.)
- Climate Preference (cool/intermediate/warm)
- Leaf Form
- Pseudobulb Presence
- Cultural Tips (light, temp, water, fert.)
- Image Source
- Photographer/Credit
- OCR Text Extract
- AI Confidence Level
- Ingestion Source (legacy form, scraped, direct upload)

Automation Modules
1. Photo Upload Ingestion → File Rename → Metadata Extraction (AI/OCR) → Logging
2. Website Scrapers for:
   - Gary Yong Gee
   - Roberta Fox
   - Others (future)
3. Metadata Normalizer → Matching against TAXONOMY_MASTER
4. Image Classifier → Orchid Validator
5. Widget Feed Generator → Orchid of Day, Member Gallery, Cultural Assistant

Integration Needs
- All databases must link back to the TAXONOMY_MASTER to ensure metadata standardization.
- Widgets must pull live or cached data based on user action or local weather conditions.
- Admin script to trigger batch refresh and database sync on schedule (or via webhook).

Desired Output / Format
Please export this full system prompt into one document that can be copied into another AI assistant or programming interface to rebuild, improve, or automate the full system end-to-end.
