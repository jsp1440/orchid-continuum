Prompt for AI Developer — Weather / Habitat Comparison Widget

Objective:
Redesign the weather comparison widget so orchid growers can compare their local growing environment with an orchid’s native habitat, using fair and biologically meaningful alignment methods.

⸻

1. Modes (User Toggle)
    •    Calendar Mode (raw): Compare today’s conditions at both locations directly.
    •    Seasonal Mode (default): Align by seasonal phase (wet/dry, summer/winter) using 30-year climate normals. Automatically adjust hemisphere offset.
    •    Photoperiod Mode (precise): Align by daylength and solar time (e.g., 9:00 AM solar local vs 9:00 AM solar at habitat with matching daylength).

⸻

2. Charts
    •    Hourly Chart (line overlay): Local vs. habitat temperature & humidity, aligned by solar time.
    •    Seasonal Chart (band plot): Local weekly averages vs. habitat monthly normals (with shaded bands for typical range).

⸻

3. Transparency Badges

Display badges above the charts:
    •    Hemisphere offset (e.g., “+6 months”)
    •    Solar alignment status
    •    Elevation adjustment applied
    •    Confidence level: High / Medium / Low

Expandable “Details” drawer lists:
    •    Data sources (station, elevation, distance).
    •    Alignment method (calendar / seasonal / photoperiod).
    •    Adjustments (elevation, interpolation formulas).

⸻

4. Plain English Insights

Generate text summaries beneath charts:
    •    Seasonal Example:
“Your greenhouse today (72 °F, 48% RH) vs. habitat late-summer (71–75 °F, 65% RH). You are ~17% drier than habitat conditions for this phase.”
    •    Photoperiod Example:
“At solar 9:00 AM your humidity is 42%. Habitat-matched hour: 60% (–18 pts). Suggestion: add brief morning misting.”

⸻

5. Integration
    •    Must be embeddable inside My Orchid Collection Hub (opens from orchid detail page).
    •    Auto-load orchid habitat coordinates & elevation.
    •    Adjust advice based on environment setting: indoor, outdoor, greenhouse, lights.
    •    Allow export: add comparison data into weekly Culture Card PDF.

⸻

6. Responsiveness
    •    Desktop: Display both charts side by side with badges above, insight below.
    •    Mobile: Stack charts vertically with badges collapsed into a compact row.
    •    All elements must be visible without awkward scrolling.

⸻

7. Failover
    •    If habitat data missing:
    •    Show message: “Habitat data unavailable. Using nearest climate proxy.”
    •    Confidence badge automatically downgraded to Medium or Low.
