Orchid Atlas / Continuum — Master Prompt

Instruction for AI/Developers:
Build a scalable Orchid Atlas system for the Five Cities Orchid Society website. It must support 100,000+ orchid images with rich metadata, display them in multiple formats (gallery, map, daily feature), and include a hidden conservation widget for future use.

⸻

1) Data Handling
    •    Ingest orchid photos + metadata (genus, species, hybrid, location, elevation, date observed, bloom season, flower color, pollinator, growth habit, fragrance, conservation status, contributor).
    •    Store metadata in a structured database with fast filtering (index key fields).
    •    Support photo upload with auto-tagging from OCR (orchid labels) + AI-assisted trait detection.

⸻

2) Gallery View
    •    Grid or list view with lazy-loading.
    •    Filters: member/contributor, country, region, elevation, genus/species, hybrid flag, bloom season, flower color, fragrance, pollinator.
    •    Sort options: newest, oldest, alphabetic, elevation, contributor.
    •    Clicking a photo opens a detail panel with full metadata.

⸻

3) Map View
    •    Interactive map (Mapbox or equivalent).
    •    Plot occurrences with clustering + heatmap toggle.
    •    Filters synced with gallery (country, region, elevation, month/year, traits).
    •    Show uncertainty rings if coordinates are imprecise.
    •    Clicking a map marker opens the same detail panel.
    •    Time slider to animate bloom periods (month/year).

⸻

4) Orchid of the Day Widget
    •    Automatically select orchids with rich metadata.
    •    Display full-screen photo + genus/species name.
    •    Auto-generate caption in FCOS voice:
    •    Kind, compassionate, scientifically accurate, trauma-informed, whimsical/artful.
    •    Mention origin, habitat, pollinator, ecological role, morphology, and any interesting historical fact.
    •    End caption with a short haiku or artistic reflection about that orchid.
    •    “Learn More” button expands to show full metadata record.

⸻

5) Conservation Widget (Hidden Draft Mode)
    •    Build as a modular widget that can be turned on/off.
    •    When active, it should:
    •    Display global orchid conservation projects (CITES, IUCN, Orchid Conservation Alliance, Kew).
    •    Overlay conservation status on the orchid map.
    •    Allow citizen-science style submissions (similar to Encyclopedia of Life or iNaturalist) where members can upload sightings/photos.
    •    Keep unpublished until site is ready.

⸻

6) Citizen-Science Integration
    •    Allow members/visitors to upload orchid sightings with metadata.
    •    Store uploads separately but compatible with GBIF/iNaturalist format.
    •    Prepare for future export to Half-Earth or Map of Life.

⸻

7) Performance & Scale
    •    Database must handle 100k+ records.
    •    Virtualized gallery for smooth browsing.
    •    Efficient spatial queries for map rendering.
    •    Caching + CDN for images.

⸻

✅ End Goal:
A proof-of-concept orchid biodiversity platform that:
    •    Engages members with galleries, maps, and daily orchid features.
    •    Prepares FCOS to integrate with global biodiversity initiatives (Half-Earth, Map of Life, GBIF).
    •    Includes a hidden conservation widget that can go public when the Society is ready.

⸻

✨ This prompt basically says to Famous AI: “Build me a modular Orchid Atlas system now for FCOS, with a hidden conservation dashboard so I can turn it on when I’m ready to scale into global biodiversity networks.”
