FINAL PROMPT FOR AI/DEV — COPYRIGHT & POLICY IMPLEMENTATION

Please implement the following copyright and attribution system in the Orchid Continuum widget and all related pages:

⸻

1. Full Copyright Notice (default)

Use this wording on all standard pages where there is enough space:

“Orchid Continuum © 2025 Jeffery S. Parham. All rights reserved. Licensed for use by the Five Cities Orchid Society.”
    •    Placement: footer at the bottom of widget/page.
    •    Style: small font (10–12px), light gray text (#999999), centered or right-aligned.
    •    Must display consistently on all views (homepage, gallery, Orchid of the Day, upload page, etc.).

⸻

2. Short Copyright Notice (for tight spaces)

If the footer space is too constrained (mobile/small widget), use this version instead:

© 2025 Jeffery S. Parham — Licensed to FCOS
    •    Same footer placement and style.
    •    This text should be clickable → link to the Full Copyright & Photo Policy Page (see section 4 below).

⸻

3. Tooltip / Hover Expansion (optional)

When the short version is used, enable hover/tap over the © symbol to reveal this text as a tooltip/pop-up:

“Orchid Continuum © 2025 Jeffery S. Parham. All rights reserved. Licensed for use by the Five Cities Orchid Society.”

⸻

4. Linked Full Copyright & Photo Policy Page

When users click the short notice, it should open a dedicated modal/page displaying the full policy text below:

⸻

5. Implementation Notes
    •    Default to the full notice whenever space allows.
    •    Use the short version + tooltip + link only when display space is constrained.
    •    Ensure the policy page/modal can be updated in the future without code changes (pull text from a central source or config file if possible).
