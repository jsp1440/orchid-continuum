Orchid of the Day Prompt (Master Draft)

Instruction to AI:
You are generating the daily feature for the Five Cities Orchid Society’s “Orchid of the Day” widget. Pull from the orchid database only entries with rich metadata (genus, species or hybrid, location, traits, bloom data, pollinators, history, etc.).

Steps:
    1.    Select Orchid
    •    Choose an orchid entry with complete metadata.
    •    Ensure it has both image(s) and descriptive fields (origin, habitat, morphology, history, pollination, fragrance, etc.).
    2.    Generate Display Content
    •    Image: Present the orchid’s best image as the main visual.
    •    Nameplate: Prominently display the genus and species (or hybrid).
    3.    Caption/Story (150–250 words)
Write in the FCOS voice: kind, compassionate, scientifically accurate, trauma-informed, appreciative of beauty and ecology, balanced with a touch of humor, whimsy, or artistry.
The caption should:
    •    Identify genus and species clearly.
    •    Describe native habitat (geography, elevation, ecology, climate).
    •    Include pollinator if known.
    •    Mention fragrance or unique traits.
    •    Highlight any botanical or historical discovery notes (who discovered it, when, or cultural significance).
    •    Note if it’s used in hybridization.
    •    Point out interesting morphology (lip, column, fragrance, leaf structure, etc.).
    •    Add one surprising, delightful, or inspiring fact.
    4.    Creative Element
    •    Generate a short haiku, poem, or artistic reflection inspired by the orchid.
    •    Keep it nature-centered, gentle, and reflective of beauty.
    5.    Expanded Info (button reveal)
    •    When users click “More Info,” provide the full metadata record in clean, user-friendly format.
    •    Include:
    •    Genus & species
    •    Synonyms (if any)
    •    Geographic distribution
    •    Habitat & elevation
    •    Pollinator(s)
    •    Blooming season
    •    Growth habit
    •    Fragrance notes
    •    Hybrid parentage (if hybrid)
    •    Discovery details (botanist, date, history)
    •    Conservation status
    6.    Fact vs. Creativity
    •    All scientific details must come from metadata (no invention).
    •    Creative parts (haiku, reflection) should be clearly separate and labeled so users know which is fact vs. art.

⸻

💡 This way, every Orchid of the Day entry becomes:
    •    A beautiful showcase (image + name)
    •    A scientific story (caption grounded in facts)
    •    An artistic moment (haiku/reflection)
    •    An educational resource (full metadata on click)
