    "abstract": "A new endemic species of Isoetes from Fujian, China, which was previously identified as I. orientalis, is described and illustrated. In this study, we observed its leaf cross-cut characteristics under a microscope and spore morphology characteristics under a scanning electron microscope, counted its chromosome number, and compared population genetic differences between this hexaploid and I. orientalis based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) extracted from whole-genome resequencing data. We found that this hexaploid differs from I. orientalis in both leaf morphology and spore ornamentation, and that the two also exhibit significant differences in population genetics. Based on this comprehensive evidence, we identified the hexaploid as a new species and named it I. fokiensis. Here, we formally describe this hexaploid species and provide an identification key to the Isoetes species reported from China.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "title": "Mycorhizomes and ectomycorrhizal associations facilitate a mycoheterotrophic nutritional mode in the green orchid Cymbidium kanran.",
    "abstract": "Nutritional modes in mature orchids range from complete autotrophy to full mycoheterotrophy. Within the genus Cymbidium, interspecific variation in the degree of mycoheterotrophy has been documented, yet intraspecific variation remains poorly understood. Intriguingly, some green Cymbidium species often possess mycorhizomes (coralloid rhizomes), structures commonly found in fully mycoheterotrophic orchids, and morphologically similar to fully mycoheterotrophic seedlings (protocorms). This study examines Cymbidium kanran individuals with and without mycorhizomes to assess whether these specialized subterranean structures enhance fungal carbon acquisition through the use of stable isotope analyses (δ13C and δ15N) and high-throughput metabarcoding techniques. Cymbidium kanran with mycorhizomes exhibit significantly elevated δ13C and δ15N compared to autotrophic reference species and congeneric individuals lacking mycorhizomes. The mycorhizome-bearing plants are partially mycoheterotrophic, obtaining nearly half of their carbon from fungi. The degree of mycoheterotrophy is similar to that of other partially mycoheterotrophic Cymbidium species, such as C. lancifolium and C. goeringii. Fungal community profiling revealed that mycorhizome-bearing C. kanran individuals mostly associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi, such as Sebacinaceae, whereas individuals lacking mycorhizomes primarily recruit non-ectomycorrhizal rhizoctonia fungi. Notably, this morphological and nutritional plasticity parallels patterns observed in other orchid lineages, such as Cremastra and Oreorchis, which associate with wood-decay fungi. The findings strongly suggest that persistent protocorm-like mycorhizomes enhance fungal carbon uptake in partially mycoheterotrophic orchids associated not only with wood-decaying fungi but also with ectomycorrhizal fungi. These insights expand understanding of orchid nutritional strategies and highlight how intraspecific morphological plasticity may contribute to the evolution of mycoheterotrophy.© 2025 Wiley‐VCH GmbH.

    "title": "Stage-Specific Lipidomes of Gastrodia elata Extracellular Vesicles Modulate Fungal Symbiosis.",
    "abstract": "The mycoheterotrophic orchid Gastrodia elata relies entirely on symbiosis with Armillaria for nutrient acquisition during tuber development. The signaling mechanisms underlying this interaction have long been a research focus, and several pathways, such as phytohormone-mediated signaling, have been reported. However, the role of plant-derived extracellular vesicles (PDEVs) in G. elata-Armillaria communication remains unexplored. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive lipidomic analysis of G. elata-derived extracellular vesicles (GDEVs) isolated from juvenile, immature (active symbiosis), and mature tubers. By employing high-resolution mass spectrometry and advanced statistical methods, we established a detailed EV lipidome profile for G. elata, identifying 996 lipid species spanning eight major classes. Distinct lipidomic remodeling was observed throughout tuber maturation. Notably, as the immature stage corresponds to the period of peak symbiotic activity, targeted lipidome comparisons enabled the identification of core lipid markers, particularly Glc-sitosterols and the polyketide 7,8-dehydroastaxanthin, which are highly enriched during active symbiosis and potentially associated with inter-kingdom communication. These findings suggest that developmentally regulated lipid transport via EVs plays a critical role in mediating G. elata-Armillaria interaction. Our work not only illuminates the contribution of vesicle lipids to plant-fungal interaction but also provides a methodological foundation for investigating EV-mediated signaling in non-model plant-microbe systems.",

    "title": "Regulation of Flower Bud Differentiation Hormones and Identification of Related Key Genes in Dendrobium officinale Based on Multi-omics Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Dendrobium officinale, an orchid of significant medicinal and ornamental value, exhibits poorly characterized hormonal regulation of flower bud differentiation. To address this knowledge gap, we employed an integrated multi-omics approach combining physiological, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and network analyses to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the coordinated action of 6-Benzylaminopurine (6-BA) and Gibberellin A3 (GA3) in this critical developmental process. Our key findings reveal that combined 6-BA and GA3 treatment significantly enhances flower bud differentiation and induces stage-specific fluctuations in soluble sugar, protein, and starch levels. Transcriptomic profiling identified 11,994 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with DEGs specific to the hormone-treated stage showing pronounced enrichment in plant hormone signal transduction and plant-pathogen interaction pathways. Metabolomic analysis uncovered 18 stage-specific differential metabolites (DAMs) during hormone treatment, including GA3, 6-BA, and OPDA, whose accumulation dynamics were strongly correlated with the progression of differentiation. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) pinpointed key hub genes within the yellow module, notably transcription factors from the C2H2, bZIP, and NAC families. Their interaction network demonstrated significant correlation with the transcriptional regulation of hormone-responsive genes. Significantly, this study establishes the first molecular framework for 6-BA and GA3 regulation of flower bud differentiation in D. officinale. We demonstrate a metabolomic-transcriptomic coordination network driven by these hormones, where key hub genes form regulatory modules with transcription factors. Dynamic shifts in endogenous hormones reinforce the flowering signal. These findings provide crucial molecular targets for precision flowering control and molecular breeding strategies in orchids.",

    "abstract": "Anoectochilus roxburghii, a valuable medicinal orchid, is severely threatened by drought stress. This study investigated its drought tolerance mechanisms focusing on late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins and WRKY transcription factors (TFs). Physiological analyses showed that SLs treatment significantly reduced relative water content (RWC) and relative electrical conductivity (REC) compared to drought-stressed controls. Transcriptomic screening and qRT-PCR analyses identified ArLEA5/9 and ArWRKY57/70 as key drought-responsive genes, whose expression was upregulated under drought but suppressed by SLs. Overexpression of these genes in tobacco leaves and A. roxburghii protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) resulted in reduced water loss and enhanced drought resistance, with increased soluble proteins, proline, and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC), and yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays confirmed that ArWRKY57 forms a plasma membrane complex with ArWRKY70 and directly regulates ArLEA5 transcription. This study represents the first to identify candidate drought-resistant genes (ArLEA5, ArLEA9, ArWRKY57, and ArWRKY70) and characterize the ArWRKY57-ArWRKY70-ArLEA5 regulatory module as a key mechanism underlying drought tolerance in A. roxburghii, thereby facilitating molecular breeding for drought-tolerant medicinal orchids.Copyright © 2025.

    "title": "Water as a Compass: Hydrostimulation-Triggered Aerial Root Growth in Phalaenopsis aphrodite.",
    "abstract": "Epiphytic orchids have evolved specialized adaptive strategies, such as aerial roots with water-absorbing velamen tissues, to cope with water-scarce and nutrient-deficient habitats. Our previous study revealed that the aerial roots of the epiphytic orchid Phalaenopsis aphrodite lack a gravitropic response, raising the possibility that alternative tropic mechanisms may contribute to their adaptation. In this study, we examined the effects of light and moisture on aerial root growth in P. aphrodite. Surprisingly, we found that light had no effect on root growth orientation. In contrast, localized moisture gradients consistently directed the growth of young aerial roots, indicating a hydrotropic response. To explore the underlying regulatory mechanisms, we performed hormone profiling of hydrostimulated root tissues. Our data showed that indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and abscisic acid (ABA) levels did not differ significantly between the water-facing and air-facing sides of the roots, suggesting other mechanisms may regulate this hydrotropism. In summary, our findings demonstrate that hydrotropism, rather than phototropism or gravitropism, guides aerial root growth in P. aphrodite. This hydrotropic response may represent a key adaptation that enables epiphytic orchids to effectively acquire water in the forest canopy.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "To develop and validate predictive machine learning model capable of estimating long-term pH profiles (up to 672 h) of calcium silicate-based cements (CSCs) using early-stage pH measurements (3 and 24 h).pH and calcium ion release data from in vitro studies (2014 - 2024) were extracted and analysed using descriptive statistics and correlation metrics. Feature selection was conducted using Random Forest regressors to identify key variables. A hybrid stacked ensemble model was built, integrating Gradient Boosting Regressors (GBRs) as base models and sequential multilayer perceptron as a meta-model. Model calibration involved polynomial regression and residual correction with GBRs. Predictive performance was evaluated using MAE, RMSE, R², and k-fold cross-validation. Experimental in vitro validation was conducted using four commercial and three experimental CSCs (specimen surface area: 113, 169 and 220 mm²), comparing actual and predicted pH values at 72, 168, and 672 h.The model achieved strong predictive accuracy (R² = 0.91, 0.89, and 0.85 for 72, 168, and 672 h) with consistent performance across validation folds. Residuals showed no systematic bias, and Bland-Altman plots confirmed agreement. Experimental validation demonstrated a strong correlation (R² > 0.80), with no statistically significant differences across time points or specimen surface areas. The model generalized well across commercial and experimental formulations.The machine learning model was able to predict the alkalinity evolution of CSCs based on early pH measurements and specimen surface area. The approach reduces the need for prolonged testing and large specimen numbers, supporting biomaterials development and the design of next-generation endodontic materials.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of DCA injections for reducing flank fat.We assessed the efficacy and safety of DCA injections for flank fat reduction over a 12-week period using imaging, anthropometric data, Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) scoring, participant satisfaction, and standardized adverse event reporting.Adults aged 21-65 years with mild to moderate flank fat (≥ 2 cm) received two sessions of 10 mg/mL DCA injections, 6 weeks apart. Standardized ultrasound and caliper measurements were performed prior to each session. Injections were administered at 0.1-0.15 mL per 1 × 1 cm2 area, with a maximum of 2 mL per flank per session, following standardized marking and injection protocols.Thirty participants (mean age 34.9 years; 86.7% female) completed the study. By Week 12, 86.7% showed aesthetic improvement based on GAIS score, with significant reductions in waist circumference and fat thickness (measured using caliper and ultrasound; p < 0.001). The procedure was generally safe, with most adverse events being mild to moderate and limited to the injection site.DCA injections effectively reduced localized flank fat after two treatment sessions, resulting in significant aesthetic improvements. Adverse events were mostly mild and manageable, with no serious complications.© 2025 The Author(s). Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

    "abstract": "The taxonomy of Paphiopedilum-a diverse group of slipper orchids-has long posed challenges due to high morphological variability and conflicting phylogenetic signals. Despite intensive research, a clear and stable infrageneric classification remains unresolved.We present an integrative phylogenetic framework based on multiple nuclear low-copy genes (XDH, PHYC, LFY, RAD51, ACO, DEF4), ITS and plastid (matK) sequences, supported by morphological and biogeographical data. Our analyses consistently recovered monophyletic clades corresponding to both historically recognized and newly proposed lineages. Phylogenetic incongruence observed both between different nuclear loci and between nuclear and plastid phylogenies suggests a reticulate evolutionary history shaped by ancient hybridization events and incomplete lineage sorting. Biogeographic reconstructions place the genus' origin in mainland of Southeast Asia during the Miocene, with subsequent radiation influenced by climatic and geological events. As a result, we propose a revised classification recognizing three genera-Parvisepalum, Brachypetalum, and Paphiopedilum s.str.-with the latter subdivided into six subgenera.This study provides the most comprehensive phylogenetic and taxonomic treatment of Paphiopedilum to date. Our framework reflects evolutionary relationships more accurately than previous systems and offers a stable basis for future research in orchid systematics, conservation, and evolution.© 2025.

The commercial production of variegated C. lancifolium through traditional propagation methods faces significant challenges, such as low propagation rates and prolonged growth periods. This study aims to develop effective in vitro propagation techniques for variegated C. lancifolium through asymbiotic seed germination to enhance production efficiency and meet market demand. We examined the effects of various plant growth regulators and coconut water (CW) on in vitro seed germination. The highest germination percentage (46.8%) was recorded in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 50 mL/L CW, 4.0 µM α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), 2.3 µM kinetin (KN), and 2.9 µM gibberellic acid (GA3). Seed-derived rhizomes were placed on MS medium containing indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), and NAA for proliferation. Among the auxins, NAA was the most effective, significantly increasing rhizome proliferation, with the highest number (17.4) and length (2.1 cm) observed at 5.0 µM. The rhizome explants were cultured in MS medium enriched with kinetin (KN), N6-(2-isopentenyl)adenine (2-IP), and N6-benzyladenine (BA) to promote plantlet regeneration. Of the cytokinins tested, BA at 10.0 µM resulted in the highest rate of plantlet regeneration (79.4%), the greatest number of plantlets (4.4 per culture), and notable plantlet height (8.5 cm). We obtained plantlets with dark green leaves, light green leaves, and distinct variegation patterns. They were transferred to three different substrate mixtures for acclimatization. The substrate made of orchid stone (30%), wood bark (30%), coconut husk chips (20%), and perlite (20%) supported the highest survival rate (95.9%). This study successfully established optimized in vitro propagation techniques for variegated C. lancifolium, enabling enhanced germination, rhizome proliferation, and plantlet regeneration to meet the growing market demand.",

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: This study aimed to develop a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) system incorporating a catechin-rich Vanda coerulea extract for topical cosmetic applications and to evaluate its physicochemical properties, release behavior, and skin retention performance. Methods: Blank NLCs were prepared using hot emulsification followed by sonication, with glyceryl monostearate, caprylic triglyceride, Poloxamer® 188, and Tween® 80 as the formulation components. NLCs with varying solid-to-liquid lipid ratios were developed while maintaining a constant total lipid content of 5% w/w. The formulations were characterized based on their particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, and physical stability, including stability after a heating-cooling cycle test. The effect of ultrasonication duration was also evaluated. The optimized NLC was then loaded with a V. coerulea extract and evaluated for in vitro release and skin retention using catechin as a marker. Results: The NLC with a particle size of 235.5 ± 29.8 nm, a narrow PDI range of 0.382 ± 0.090, and a strong zeta potential of -29.8 ± 0.3 mV was selected for the incorporation of the V. coerulea extract. The extract-loaded NLC exhibited a sustained release over 24 h, significantly different from the V. coerulea extract solution (p < 0.05). Skin retention studies revealed that the NLC achieved approximately twice the catechin retention compared to the solution at the 1 h time point (1.30 ± 0.01% vs. 0.68 ± 0.03% w/w). Conclusions: The V. coerulea-extract-loaded NLC demonstrated favorable physicochemical properties, sustained release behavior, and enhanced skin retention. These findings support its potential as a promising topical delivery system for antioxidant-rich botanical extracts in cosmetic applications.",

    "abstract": "(1) Objective: This study aimed to systematically elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which gypenosides (GP), a major active component of Gynostemma pentaphyllum, ameliorate hypercholesterolemia by modulating the hepatic steroidogenesis pathway, and to identify key therapeutic targets. (2) Methods: We established a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hypercholesterolemia (HC) mouse model and performed GP intervention. An integrated multi-omics approach, combining transcriptomics and proteomics, was utilized to comprehensively analyze GP's effects on the expression of genes and proteins associated with hepatic cholesterol synthesis, transport, and steroid hormone metabolism. (3) Results: HFD induced significant dysregulation, with 48 steroidogenesis pathway-related genes and 35 corresponding proteins exhibiting altered expression in HC mouse livers. GP treatment remarkably reversed these HFD-induced abnormalities, significantly restoring the expression levels of 42 genes and 14 proteins. Multi-omics integration identified seven critical genes/proteins-Cyp3a25, Fdft1, Tm7sf2, Hmgcs1, Fdps, Mvd, and Pmvk-that were consistently and significantly regulated by GP at both transcriptional and translational levels. Furthermore, correlation analyses demonstrated that Cyp3a25 was significantly negatively correlated with serum total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), whereas Fdft1, Tm7sf2, Hmgcs1, Fdps, Mvd, and Pmvk showed significant positive correlations. (4) Conclusions: GP effectively ameliorates cholesterol dyshomeostasis through a multi-targeted mechanism in the liver. It inhibits endogenous cholesterol synthesis by downregulating key enzymes (Hmgcs1, Fdft1, Pmvk, Mvd, Fdps, Tm7sf2), promotes cholesterol efflux and transport (upregulating Abca1, ApoB), and accelerates steroid hormone metabolism (upregulating Cyp3a11, Cyp3a25). These findings provide robust scientific evidence for the development of GP as a safe and effective novel therapeutic agent for hypercholesterolemia.",

    "abstract": "Oxalis triangularis 'Purpurea' is an ornamental plant that exhibits nyctinastic movement. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The nyctinastic movement of the leaflets is regulated by a motor organ termed the pulvinus, in which the flexor cells and extensor cells adjust their osmosis potential antagonistically to drive the opening or closure of the leaflets. This study investigates the factors essential for the nyctinastic movement in O. triangularis 'Purpurea'. The critical structural and subcellular changes of the pulvini that facilitate the opening or closing movement of leaflets were revealed by sectioning and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The dynamic and significant changes of phytohormones [Auxin (IAA), Abscisic acid (ABA), Cytokinin (cis-Zeatin, cZ and trans-Zeatin, tZ), Gibberellin (GA), Salicylic acid (SA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC, the ethylene precursor)] were detected during the leaflets opening or closing, and their contributions to nyctinastic movement were determined by exogenous application. Furthermore, dynamic but opposite Ca2+ flux was observed in the flexor and extensor cells during leaflets opening or closure, and the Ca2+ channel blocker disrupted normal leaflets movement. Transcriptomic analysis of the pulvini revealed key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during leaflets opening and closing, and these DEGs are enriched in the function categories of circadian clock, hormone signaling, and ion channels. Notably, the core circadian clock gene, OtLHY, was demonstrated to be required for the nyctinastic movement of O. triangularis 'Purpurea' by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). Based on these findings, we propose a regulatory network involving the circadian clock, phytohormones, and ion channels that coordinate the nyctinastic movement of O. triangularis 'Purpurea'.© 2025 Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of flowering plants depend on animal pollinators for sexual reproduction. These plants usually provide a reward, such as nectar and/or pollen, to their pollinators, and floral scent is often key to attract them. Some plants, however, do not provide any such reward, though they advertise one. Even though it is well known that such a food-deceptive pollination strategy is particularly common in orchids, the role of floral scent in attracting pollinators in such systems is often poorly understood. In this study, we compared the floral scent of the Eurasian deceptive lady's slipper orchid Cypripedium calceolus with six co-flowering rewarding species visited by the same pollinators. Cypripedium calceolus produced more floral scent compounds than the co-flowering rewarding species together and differed in the floral scent composition from them. However, C. calceolus shared at least one compound with each co-flowering rewarding species, including widespread and less widespread compounds among flower scents, and had more compounds in common with the co-flowering rewarding species than they had with each other. Several compounds of C. calceolus, such as the aliphatic compounds 1-octanol, octyl acetate, and decyl acetate, did not occur in co-flowering plants but are known as pheromones of pollinating bees. Together, our results suggest that C. calceolus not only emits compounds that are generally common among flowering plants and attractive to many pollinators but specifically imitates floral scent compounds of multiple co-flowering plant species/pheromones of bees. These findings provide valuable insights into the ecology and evolution of floral scent in deceptive pollination systems in orchids.Copyright © 2025 Etl, Etl, Guilhot, Braunschmid, Gross and Dötterl.",

We further completed the GelFAP v3.0 upgrade ( http://www.gzybioinformatics.cn/Gelv3 ), integrating results and adding tools like BLAST, Gene sets enrichment analysis, Extract sequence, JBrowse v2, multiple sequence alignment, DEG analysis, DEM analysis, primer design and heatmap analysis. Through this platform, we identified that the GeMYB4 gene may function as a potential suppressor of flavonoid biosynthesis. Additionally, the platform enabled the identification of GePAL1, a key gene in the phenylpropanoid pathway, which showed higher expression in G.elata f.glauca compared to f.elata and was co-expressed with other upregulated genes involved in phenolic compound biosynthesis. Using GeMYB4 and GePAL1 as cases, we demonstrate the utility of this platform. GelFAP v3.0 will aid in analyzing key genes related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, stress response, growth and development, offering researchers enhanced resources for studying G.elata gene functions.© 2025.

    "abstract": "Fusarium wilt is a major agricultural disease causing significant crop losses. In Taiwan, several Fusarium species have been reported to cause yellow leaf disease symptoms in orchids. This study identified five isolates of Fusarium oxysporum (Fo) isolates (pfy-1 to pfy-5) based on phylogenetic analyses of the internal transcribed spacer of the nuclear rDNA, translation elongation factor 1-α, and sterol 14 α-demethylase genes. Multi-locus phylogenetic analysis using combined sequences of calmodulin, the second largest subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II, translation elongation factors, and β-tubulin II sequences grouped pfy-1 to pfy-4 within F. veterinarium (bootstrap value 87). However, morphological characteristics of the colonies and conidia of four Fo isolates were not match to F. veterinarium (ex-type culture CBS 109898). Mycelial growth of pfy-1 grows best at 28°C and pH 6.0, with high sporulation at 32°C, pH 5.5, and in darkness. Further phylogenetic analysis of the intergenic spacer (IGS) region and exopolygalacturonase gene 1 (pgx1) separated the five Fo isolates into two distinct clades. Pathogenicity tests on carnation, strawberry, common bean, and 47 cultivars of orchids was determined using the whole-plant inoculation method. The results showed that pfy-5 infected Vanilla and Phalaenopsis, while pfy-1 specifically infected Phalaenopsis. Based on genetic and phytogenetic characteristic, Fo isolate pfy-1 is proposed as a new forma specialis, named F. oxysporum f. sp. phalaenopsidis, which specific to Phalaenopsis orchids. The identification of this new forma specialis is important for both research and practical applications in orchid cultivation.",

    "title": "Comprehensive analysis of Dof transcription factors in Dendrobium species and functional characterization of DoDof4 in the accumulation of water-soluble polysaccharides.",
    "abstract": "Dendrobium is a multi-purpose medicinal orchid that grows on the edge of high-altitude cliffs. The content of water-soluble polysaccharides (WSPs), which primarily play a pharmacological role, is the main criterion for evaluating the quality of Dendrobium orchid. Therefore, it is necessary to study the regulatory manner involved in the accumulation of WSPs.D. officinale were treated with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and WSPs content was measured at different time points to assess the dynamic accumulation pattern. To clarify the role of one finger (Dof) family genes in the MeJA-mediated WSP metabolic pathway, a bioinformatics analysis identified Dof members in D. huoshanense, D. nobile and D. officinale. Based on expression patterns and co-expression analysis, a regulatory factor, DoDof4 was identified.In this study, the elicitation of D. officinale by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) increased WSP production, which was further amplified by extending the treatment period. Analysis of transcriptomic data revealed that members of the DNA-binding with Dof gene family members accounted for 4% of all differentially expressed genes coding for transcription factors, following MeJA induction. To clarify the role of Dof family genes in the MeJA-mediated WSP metabolic pathway, a bioinformatics analysis identified 29, 29 and 22 Dof members in D. huoshanense, D. nobile and D. officinale, respectively and these were divided into four groups. DoDof4 was encoded a 31.16 kDa protein composed of 292 amino acids, and was targeted on chromosome 3. Furthermore, DoDof4 was a typical transcription factor that localized in the nucleus, displayed transcriptional activity and increased the WSPs accumulation. DoDof4 was co-expressed with 15 genes involved in the WSP metabolic pathway, eight of which displayed a positive Pearson's correlation coefficient. Additionally, correlation analysis revealed the possible downstream targets (KM980199 and KP203853) of DoDof4.The results of the present study suggest that DoDof4 acts as an important regulator in the WSPs metabolic pathway, exhibiting potential values for the improvement of WSPs in Dendrobium species.Copyright © 2025 Xu, Zhang, Zheng, Deng, Sun, Teixeira da Silva, Shen and Yu.",

    "abstract": "Gymnadenia conopsea (L.) R. Br., a medicinally significant orchid used for millennia in China, is systematically reviewed regarding its botany, resources, ethnomedicinal applications, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and propagation strategies to advance therapeutic utilization and conservation.Using keywords such as \"G. conopsea,\" \"phytochemistry,\" \"propagation and breeding,\" \"bioactive compounds,\" \"immunomodulatory effects,\" and \"neuroprotective potential,\" we systematically searched literature related to G. conopsea plants from databases including Web of Science, SciFinder, PubMed, ACS Publications, CNKI, Wanfang Data, Google Scholar, and Baidu Scholar.A total of 1,074 papers were retrieved and 133 full-text articles were ultimately selected and comprehensively reviewed. Up to now, over 203 metabolites have been identified in the tubers of G. conopsea, including benzyl ester glucosides, stilbenoids, phenanthrenes, phenolic derivatives, alkaloids and polysaccharides. Pharmacological studies validate its multi-target therapeutic potential across tonification, anti-fatigue interventions, oxidative stress mitigation, antiviral defense, and management of gastric ulcers and silicosis. Despite extensive research on the pharmacological properties of crude extracts, the relationship between specific bioactive compounds and their corresponding pharmacological activities, particularly in vivo, remains poorly understood. Critically, overexploitation and habitat degradation have led to its classification as an endangered species. Current propagation efforts face significant challenges, including low natural germination rates, and dependence on specific habitats and obligate mycorrhizal fungi, precluding the development of efficient large-scale cultivation and seedling production systems.Marked progress has been made in characterizing small-molecule metabolites of G. conopsea, yet comprehensive structural elucidation of polysaccharides remains incomplete. Additionally, research must be intensified on synergistic interactions of bioactive constituents, molecular targets, mechanisms of action, and in vivo metabolic pathways to facilitate development of a quality standard system. For propagation, wild-simulated cultivation should be adopted for resource conservation, while optimizing symbiotic germination techniques is critical to overcome propagation bottlenecks, ultimately enabling sustainable utilization.Copyright © 2025 Wu, Tang, Wang, Chen, Liu, Wang, Li and Jiang.",

    "title": "The interplay between local biodiversity floral odours and reproductive success varies across different population sizes of Cypripedium calceolus.",
    "abstract": "To attract pollinators, individuals of the threatened and food-deceptive orchid Cypripedium calceolus (L.) employ visual and olfactory signals, notably volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, habitat fragmentation has disrupted its population into patches of still relatively large sizes, but also small sizes. We hypothesized that small orchid populations inhabit low-biodiversity areas with fewer pollinators, potentially leading to extinction. To investigate whether local biodiversity and olfactory signals vary with population size, we analysed site-specific vegetation characteristics, insect and flower visitor diversity, plant growth traits and floral VOC profiles in small and large C. calceolus populations. Our results revealed that smaller populations occupy habitats with lower biodiversity, consist of smaller plants with fewer flowers and exhibit reduced flowering success compared to larger populations. VOC profiles also varied between population sizes. However, fruit production and reproductive success did not differ, indicating that these chemical and ecological differences do not necessarily affect reproductive output. These results highlight that population size is linked to variation in plant traits and floral scent but does not directly predict reproductive success under current conditions.© 2025 The Authors.",

    "title": "Selective ERα Attenuates Hypothalamic ER Stress and Regulates Energy Homeostasis in Ovariectomized Mice Fed With High-Fat Diet.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is often caused by an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure, with the hypothalamus essential in maintaining this balance, and any impairment in its function can contribute to obesity. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) plays a significant role in controlling body weight by influencing energy intake. However, the specific processes through which ERα exerts its anorexigenic effects remain insufficiently understood. This study investigates the impact of targeted ERα activation on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the hypothalamus of mice suffering from obesity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). The animals were divided into two primary groups: ovarian-intact (Sham) and ovariectomized (OVX) mice, both of which were fed an HFD for 12 weeks. At the end, the OVX mice were further divided into two groups: OVX-HFD and OVX-HFD-PPT (ERα agonist). The findings showed that ovariectomy led to weight gain and increased energy intake in HFD mice, which were accompanied by increased levels of orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and ER-stress and decreased levels of anorexigenic α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. In contrast, treatment with PPT significantly attenuated these effects, leading to reduced body weight and energy intake. Mechanistically, PPT treatment decreased the level of NPY and increased α-MSH in the hypothalamus. Furthermore, PPT treatment reduced hypothalamic ER stress markers, such as GRP78 and ATF6, and enhanced leptin signaling by increasing the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3. We conclude that ERα activation may reduce hypothalamic ER stress and improve leptin sensitivity, thereby regulating energy intake and body weight.© 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

    "title": "Population Genetic Diversity and Species Distribution Evaluation of Bletilla striata (Orchidaceae) in Southwest China Using SSR Markers.",
    "abstract": "We assessed the genetic diversity and population structure of the protected orchid Bletilla striata across 18 wild populations in southwestern China. Eight pairs of simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers were employed for its genetic diversity and population structure analyses, while the optimized Maxent model was utilized to predict changes in the habitat distribution under historical conditions and three future climate scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585) with 141 natural distribution data and 19 climatic factors. The results revealed an average number of alleles (Na) of 3.549 and an effective number of alleles (Ne) of 2.636, with a mean polymorphic information content (PIC) of 0.748 across the B. striata populations. Moderate genetic diversity was observed (observed heterozygosity, Ho = 0.402; expected heterozygosity, He = 0.509), with 73% of the total variation found within populations, while the 02 population in Zhijin Guizhou exhibited relatively high genetic differentiation (Ho = 0.675, He = 0.658). UPGMA clustering, population structure analyses, and principal component analysis identified two primary subgroups within B. striata. Among the 19 climate variables analyzed, four temperature-related factors and two precipitation-related factors were identified as key drivers influencing the geographical distribution of B. striata. Future projections for the 2050s and 2070s under varying climate scenarios indicate a northward expansion of suitable habitats for B. striata. The proportion of suitable habitat area is expected to increase from 288.3450 × 104 km2 under historical conditions (1970-2000) to 351.9792-405.6077 × 104 km2 (2050s-2070s). The wild B. striata populations in southwestern China and adjacent regions represent valuable germplasm resources with high genetic diversity, offering significant potential for artificial cultivation initiatives. Moreover, predictions of future distribution dynamics provide critical insights to guide the conservation, development, and sustainable utilization of B. striata.© 2025 The Author(s).

In this phase III, open-label, single-sequence, and cross-over study, MPS I patients received Aldurazyme for 12 weeks, followed by Laronidase (CinnaGen) for another 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the assessment of mean uGAG levels at the final visits of each medication administration. The secondary outcomes included the assessment of 6-minute walking test (6MWT), predicted forced vital capacity (FVC), enzyme activity assay, and adverse events (AEs). Twelve patients with mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 10.25 ± 3.11 years were included in the study. The mean (± SD) uGAG level was 220.47 ± 177.13 CPC unit/g creatinine at the end of Aldurazyme treatment and changed to 270.02 ± 111.55 CPC unit/g creatinine at the end of Laronidase (CinnaGen) treatment, with variable patient responses. The mean 6MWT and predicted FVC improved by almost 30 m and 13%, respectively. Post-infusion enzyme activity levels showed similar patterns between Aldurazyme and Laronidase (CinnaGen), with no detectable activity before the infusion. A total of 30 AEs were reported during the trial. In the first time period (receiving Aldurazyme), AEs were reported for seven patients (58.33%), and in the subsequent time period (receiving Laronidase (CinnaGen)), AEs were reported for six patients (50%). Among all, nasopharyngitis was the most common reported AE. In conclusion, the biosimilar Laronidase was shown to have a comparable efficacy and safety profile compared with the reference Laronidase.Clinical Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT06406153; First registration: 09/05/2024.© 2025.

    "abstract": "Indigenous medicinal systems often incorporate wild plants and their parts. One such plant is Bombax ceiba L., also known as red silk-cotton tree, native to Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. This large deciduous tree holds cultural, economic, and medicinal significance, valued for its fiber and use in traditional medicinal systems. The flowers of B. ceiba are an excellent source of fiber and carbohydrates and contain vitamins (vitamin C) and minerals (iron, sodium, phosphorus, and calcium). Research has also shown that B. ceiba flowers are rich in phenolic compounds, which possess antioxidant properties and protect against oxidative stress and its related diseases. It also contains flavonoids, which have anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and other properties, including hepatoprotective, lipid peroxidation, anti-inflammatory, anticancer/antitumor, anti-ulcer, and antidiabetic properties. The presence of various bioactive compounds like quercetin, kaempferol, gallic acid, catechin, β-sitosterol, and mangiferin are responsible for these properties. In particular, mangiferin is well known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The focus of this review article is to provide an outline of the different types of phytochemicals found in B. ceiba flowers, as well as their biological properties and toxicity relevant to their potential applications in the development of nutraceuticals, food, and pharmaceuticals, contributing to improving human well-being.© 2025 Wiley‐VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.",

    "abstract": "Gastrodia elata Blume is an important medicinal orchid, yet its large-scale cultivation is increasingly threatened by fungal diseases. The 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL) gene family directs a key step in phenylpropanoid metabolism and plant defence, but its composition and function in G. elata have not been investigated. We mined the G. elata genome for 4CL homologues, mapped their chromosomal locations, and analysed their gene structures, conserved motifs, phylogenetic relationships, promoter cis-elements and codon usage bias. Publicly available transcriptomes were used to examine tissue-specific expression and responses to fungal infection. Subcellular localisation of selected proteins was verified by transient expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Fourteen Ge4CL genes were identified and grouped into three clades. Two members, Ge4CL2 and Ge4CL5, were strongly upregulated in tubers challenged with fungal pathogens. Ge4CL2 localised to the nucleus, whereas Ge4CL5 localised to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Codon usage analysis suggested that Escherichia coli and Oryza sativa are suitable heterologous hosts for Ge4CL expression. This study provides the first genome-wide catalogue of 4CL genes in G. elata and suggests that Ge4CL2 and Ge4CL5 may participate in antifungal defence, although functional confirmation is still required. The dataset furnishes a foundation for functional characterisation and the molecular breeding of disease-resistant G. elata cultivars.",

    "abstract": "Combined abiotic stresses often impose greater challenges to plant survival than individual stresses. In this study, we focused on elucidating the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the response of Dendrobium huoshanense to combined salt and heat stress by integrating physiological, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses. Our results demonstrated that high temperature plays a dominant role in the combined stress response. Physiological assays showed increased oxidative damage under combined stress, accompanied by significant activation of antioxidant enzyme systems (SOD, POD, CAT). Metabolomic analysis revealed significant enrichment of glutathione metabolism and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways, with key antioxidants such as glutathione and naringenin chalcone accumulating under combined stress. Transcriptomic data supported these findings, showing differential regulation of stress-related genes, including those involved in reactive oxygen species scavenging and secondary metabolism. These results highlight a coordinated defense strategy in D. huoshanense, involving both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems to maintain redox homeostasis under combined stress. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying combined stress tolerance and lays the foundation for improving stress resilience in medicinal orchids.",

    "abstract": "Ophrys apifera, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid that has expanded its range northwards in recent decades. The present study focuses on its occurrence in Poland and analyses possible causes of this expansion, including climate change, autogamy and genetic diversity of new populations. Genetic analyses using nuclear microsatellite markers and plastid DNA revealed low overall population variability in Poland and neighbouring countries (the Czech Republic, Germany), probably caused by the founder effect and bottleneck, as well as the autogamous reproductive strategy of this species. STRUCTURE analysis identified three genetic clusters, with western populations forming a distinct, homogeneous cluster, while southern populations show a greater degree of genetic mixing. Plastid haplotype diversity was limited, with most populations dominated by a single haplotype. This confirms the scenario of recent colonisation through long-distance seed dispersal. Ecological niche modelling indicates that although O. apifera will continue to spread in regions with a suitable climate in northern and central Europe, habitat loss due to rising temperatures is predicted in the southern and western parts of its range. The combination of genetic and ecological data suggests that several independent colonisation events contributed to the recent spread of O. apifera. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring genetic variation in newly established populations and further investigating the role of climate change in the range shift of orchids.© 2025.

    "abstract": "Well-resolved phylogenetic relationships within the diverse Neotropical orchid genus Lepanthes are presented based on a genome skimming approach that yielded nine newly sequenced chloroplast genomes. We complemented this with 17-86 plastome coding genes for 26 species retrieved from GenBank, alongside amplified matK and rITS regions. The Lepanthes plastomes (157,185-158,260 bp, 37.15% GC content) contained 136 annotated genes, including 86 protein-coding, 42 tRNA, and 8 rRNA genes. We identified six hypervariable regions, including parts of the ycf1 gene, as potential DNA barcodes. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Carl Luer's subgeneric classifications are non-monophyletic, a finding confirmed by PCA of continuous morphological traits, reflecting significant morphological homoplasy. Six major clades were identified, though resolution for the phylogenetic backbone remains unresolved at two nodes. Subgenus Marsipanthes is not monophyletic as currently circumscribed, with two subclades recovered in distinct positions within the phylogeny. An early-diverging lineage, comprising species restricted to the eastern Andean slopes from southern Colombia to Peru, includes members of both Marsipanthes and Lepanthes. A derived clade, consisting of species from both subgenera, confined to the Chocó biogeographic region, forms an unresolved polytomy. Although only a subset of Lepanthes diversity was sampled, this study captures significant taxonomic, geographic, and morphological variation. It provides foundational insights into the genu's evolutionary history, along with tools and hypotheses that can be expanded upon in future research to further refine our understanding of its biogeographic history.© 2025.

The survey was designed using a Likert scale and conducted between February 13 and April 21, 2024. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the frequency of different management strategies and the various factors influencing decisions related to myopia management.The respondents were mostly male (51.7%), 49.5% worked in private practice, and 52.4% had less than five years of professional experience. The most frequently used myopia control options were single-vision distance spectacles (full correction), advice to spend more time outdoors, and visual hygiene. Single-vision distance contact lenses with full correction (63.4%) were the most recommended alternative option to single-vision distance spectacles (full correction), followed by visual hygiene practices (61.8%). Myopia control spectacle lenses were used by only 1.9% of the respondents. Major barriers to effective myopia control included the need for additional clinical equipment, medico-legal concerns, and minimal financial incentives, rated as \"important\" or \"very important\" by more than 45% of respondents.Significant gaps in the adoption of advanced myopia control strategies were observed among Nigerian optometrists, largely because of perceived barriers such as financial constraints and medico-legal concerns.Copyright © 2025 Contact Lens Association of Ophthalmologists.",

Recent work in arbuscular mycorrhizae has suggested that plants can provide fatty acids (FAs) to fungi, but empirical evidence in orchids remains limited. Here, we combine lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses to test the hypothesis that the germination-promoting fungus Ceratobasidium sp. GS2 receives carbon in the form of FAs from Gymnadenia conopsea seeds during symbiotic germination. Confocal and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the potential of FA transfer from seeds to the fungus. Symbiosis resulted in significant changes in the lipid composition of the fungus, with increased concentrations of FAs in the external mycelium. RNA-seq showed upregulation of genes associated with FA synthesis in seeds and downregulation of de novo FA synthesis genes in fungi 12 d post-symbiosis, indicating that the increased amounts of FAs in the fungus may originate from the seeds. These results indicate that FAs absorbed by hyphae in the colonized inner cortex cells support hyphal growth, providing evidence for directional carbon flow from the orchid seeds to the fungus and supporting a \"give now and get now\" model of mutualism in orchid-fungus symbioses.© 2025.

    "title": "Calanquinone A suppresses glioma progression via STAT3-mediated regulation of c-Myc and MMP9.",
    "abstract": "Calanthe arisanensis, a traditional medicinal orchid, contains Calanquinone A, a quinone-type compound with reported anticancer properties. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiproliferative and antimigratory effects of Calanquinone A in GBM. Human GBM cell lines (U87MG) and patient-derived primary GBM cells (Pt#3) were treated with Calanquinone A (1-2.5 µM), and effects on cell viability, proliferation, and migration were assessed using CCK-8, trypan blue exclusion, colony formation, wound healing, transwell migration, and F-actin staining assays. Calanquinone A significantly reduced GBM cell viability and migration. Western blot analysis revealed that Calanquinone A inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705, leading to downregulation of its downstream targets c-Myc and MMP9. STAT3 overexpression reversed these effects, confirming the involvement of STAT3-dependent pathways. In a mouse xenograft model, Calanquinone A suppressed tumor formation in vivo. Molecular docking analysis further revealed a potential direct interaction between Calanquinone A and STAT3, supporting a direct mechanism of action. These findings demonstrate that Calanquinone A exerts potent antitumor effects in glioblastoma by targeting the STAT3/c-Myc and STAT3/MMP9 signaling axes, supporting its potential as a natural STAT3-targeting agent for GBM therapy.© 2025.

    "title": "Comparative analysis of 18 chloroplast genomes reveals genomic diversity and evolutionary dynamics in subtribe Malaxidinae (Orchidaceae).",
    "abstract": "The subtribe Malaxidinae encompasses diverse species, many of which possess remarkable medicinal properties that have been employed in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Although recent advancements have improved our understanding of the backbone phylogeny of Malaxidinae, clarifying the complex intergeneric relationships remains challenging, largely owing to limited genomic data. To address this gap and further investigate the genetic diversity and evolutionary patterns within this subtribe, we sequenced and assembled complete chloroplast (cp.) genomes from sixteen Malaxidinae species. These newly acquired genomic resources, combined with two previously published cp. genomes from closely related species, were incorporated into a comprehensive comparative genomic and phylogenomic analysis.The complete cp. genomes of all 18 Malaxidinae species were analyzed, revealing lengths ranging from 143,062 bp to 158,785 bp. Each genome contains 123-133 genes, including 74-86 protein-coding genes, 38 tRNA genes, 8 rRNA genes and 1-8 pseudogenes. The chloroplast genomes of Malaxidinae species exhibit significant structural diversity, with particularly pronounced variations observed in the ndhF and ycf1 genes located at the IR/SSC boundary regions. In certain species, the SSC regions showed substantial size reduction, ranging from 10,224 to 15,582 bp. Notable variability in both gene loss and truncation patterns was observed in the ndh gene family across these species, accompanied by diverse modifications affecting the length, position, and pseudogenization of the ycf1 gene. Furthermore, our study identified genomic inversions and rearrangements occurring in both the LSC and SSC regions of specific species. The detection of abundant long dispersed repeats and SSRs provides valuable molecular markers for evaluating both intrageneric and interspecific polymorphism as well as genetic diversity patterns. Through codon usage bias analysis, we established that natural selection serves as the predominant evolutionary force shaping codon usage patterns in most Malaxidinae species. Detailed sequence alignment of the chloroplast genome revealed that structural variants are primarily concentrated within single-copy regions. Ten highly variable cpDNA markers were chosen as mutational hotspots, with the potential for development as DNA barcodes for Malaxidinae species. Our phylogenomic analysis clearly resolved the Malaxidinae into three well-supported major clades. Clade I comprises species of Liparis s.s., Malaxis, and Oberonioides. Clade II includes species of Crepidium, Dienia, Diteilis and Empusa. Clade III consists of species from the genera Blepharoglossum, Cestichis, Oberonia, Platystyliparis and Stichorkis.This research provides valuable insights into the unique characteristics of the chloroplast genome in Malaxidinae orchids, significantly advancing our comprehension of their evolutionary mechanisms and phylogenetic architecture. The acquired genomic data establish a crucial foundation to advance medical resources and aid in species differentiation.© 2025. The Author(s).",

    "title": "Mesopolyploidy as a taxonomic clade marker for Brassica and relatives (tribe Brassiceae).",
    "abstract": "Whole Genome Duplications (WGD) are rampant in flowering plant genomes. Within Brassicaceae, the genus Brassica (including crop mustards) and relatives (tribe Brassiceae) are hypothesized to share an ancient mesohexaploidy, or whole genome triplication (WGT), resulting from two WGD events (Br-⍺ WGT). However, the phylogenetic boundaries of the Br-α WGT remain unknown.We use phylogenomic assessments and divergence time analyses to place and date the Br-⍺ WGT. We see conflicting topologies among the plastid and nuclear trees putatively due to polyploidy, hybridization, and reticulate evolution. Despite this, we find tribe Brassiceae to be monophyletic in both trees.As currently circumscribed, tribe Brassiceae does not share the Br-⍺ WGT. The sister clade to the rest of the tribe, containing the genera Orychophragmus and Sinalliaria, show no evidence of the Br-⍺ WGT. Based on this placement, divergence time analyses indicate that the Br-⍺ WGT would have occurred between 12.1-10.7 million years ago.We propose a new taxonomic revision for the tribe Brassiceae based on the shared characteristics of the Br-⍺ WGT. This presents a stable characteristic for the tribe, which was not the case in previous taxonomies based on morphological characters. These findings help clarify the history of the mustard crops and their relatives and resolve long-standing issues with the circumscription of the tribe Brassiceae.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Annals of Botany Company 2025.",

    "title": "Fitness landscapes of simple regulatory genetic interactions show pervasive heterozygote advantage and support stable polymorphism.",
    "abstract": "Although the regulation of gene expression is a fundamental link between genotype, phenotype, and fitness, little is known about how natural selection drives its evolution. To address this gap, we used a biophysical (thermodynamic) model of molecular interactions between allelic variants of transcription factors (TFs) and their cis-regulatory binding sites. We generated diploid genotype-phenotype maps for gene expression. We then applied a Gaussian fitness function to these maps, where the environment determines optimal expression level. The corresponding genotype-fitness landscapes are characterized by high ridges of heterozygote superiority. Heterozygote advantage occurs whenever the environmentally determined phenotypic optimum lies between the phenotypes of the two homozygotes. To determine whether this superiority could lead to stable polymorphism, for each of 201 optimal expression levels we determined frequency-fitness landscapes (allele frequency vs. fitness) for all allelic combinations; maximized their population mean fitnesses; identified combinations with globally maximal mean fitness; and found their equilibrium allele frequencies. Globally stable polymorphisms occurred whenever the phenotypic optimum laid between the phenotypes of the best two homozygotes. Stable polymorphisms occupied 49-75% of the range of optimal expression levels, depending on biophysical and fitness parameters. Virtually all included TF polymorphism, with binding site co-polymorphisms across 33-55% of the range. Neutral polymorphisms were also widely distributed. Neither molecular complexity of the TF-cis interaction nor pleiotropic constraint had qualitative effects on polymorphism. However, genetic load was negatively correlated with molecular complexity, suggesting that reducing genetic load may be an important mechanism for increasing the complexity of regulatory genetic interactions. While this analysis assumes environmental homogeneity, the results suggest that this phenomenon may enhance the role of environmental heterogeneity in maintaining regulatory polymorphism. Selection favors the maintenance of polymorphism not just because different homozygotes have higher fitness in different environments, but also because heterozygote advantage can act as a 'storage effect' by promoting regulatory polymorphism during the transitions between environmental states. We use the model to make predictions about future evolutionary trajectories in a well-documented case of regulatory heterozygote advantage involving flower color in an Alpine orchid. More empirical research on the extent and maintenance of regulatory polymorphism within populations is needed.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Rise up, Rhizoctonia: moving to one fungus, one name in the Ceratobasidiaceae (Agaricomycetes, Cantharellales).",
    "abstract": "Ceratobasidiaceae is a family of cryptic basidiomycetous fungi, most notable for the plant pathogens known under generic names such as Rhizoctonia, Thanatephorus, Ceratorhiza, and Ceratobasidium. While responsible for billions of dollars in crop losses annually, members of these genera also serve important ecological functions as orchid mycorrhizal symbionts and saprotrophs. While asexually-typified (Rhizoctonia and Ceratorhiza) and sexually-typified (Thanatephorus and Ceratobasidium) names have been utilised, molecular studies have repeatedly demonstrated these genera to be paraphyletic. In addition, the type of Ceratobasidium is not congeneric with the many other species introduced in the genus. Despite previous attempts to synonymise various names under a broadly-defined Rhizoctonia, authors have continued to describe new species using outdated generic names. Using publicly-available ITS, LSU, ATP6, RPB2, and TEF1 sequences generated from holotype specimens or from isolates obtained from permanently preserved cultures of type collections (ex-type specimens), we recovered a phylogeny of the Ceratobasidiaceae that reiterates the paraphyly of various genera within a well-supported clade to which we apply the name Rhizoctonia. We review the placements of names introduced in the genera Ceratobasidium, Ceratorhiza, and Thanatephorus, and formalise 32 new combinations in Rhizoctonia. While it is accepted that the type of Ceratobasidium does not belong in Rhizoctonia, we advocate continued use of the family name Ceratobasidiaceae and discuss a nomenclatural solution to formally cement this usage. Using Rhizoctonia as a case study, we argue that continued use of names that are evident synonyms is out of step with contemporary fungal taxonomic practice and precludes a holistic understanding of the classification and biology of this group.

    "abstract": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) is a rare condition following vaccination with adenovirus-vectored coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. This retrospective analysis of England primary care data aimed to estimate TTS event rates before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and following AZD1222 (ChAdOx1-nCoV-19) vaccination.Primary care data on TTS events were collected using the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre sentinel network. TTS events were defined as thromboembolism with coincident (± 7 days) thrombocytopenia events using Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine clinical terms (the current Brighton Collaboration definition could not be used in the study as data related to specific parameters [e.g., D-dimer or PF4 antibodies] were not available in the primary care database). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between covariates and TTS.Incident TTS rates per 100,000 person-years were: 0.42 in a pre-COVID-19 cohort (1 January, 2011-31 December, 2019; 9,062,313 individuals); 0 in 39,448 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 (1 July-31 December, 2020); 0.48 and 0.47 during the pre-vaccination pandemic period spanning 1 January-14 August, 2020 (13,245,710 individuals) and 15 August-31 December, 2020 (13,347,462 individuals); 2.41 in an AZD1222-vaccinated cohort (5,544,761 individuals; 1 January, 2021-4 July, 2022). Multivariable logistic regression analysis of TTS events (- 7/+ 42 days event-window; pre-COVID-19 cohort) showed greater odds in older individuals and high-risk groups as defined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization. Thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome was rare in all cohorts. Differential covariate distributions precluded comparisons of TTS rates across cohorts. Covariate distributions within thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia cases were comparable to those of TTS cases.Our study, using a previous definition of TTS, reinforces the very rare nature of TTS before and during the pandemic, and before and after the introduction of the AZD1222 vaccine; it also confirms the established very low incident event rate in individuals vaccinated with AZD1222.© 2025.

    "title": "Community structure of habitat microorganisms and endophytes of narrow-ranged species Corybas fanjingshanensis at different ecological niche specificities.",
    "abstract": "C. Fanjingshanensis is an extremely narrow-range species endemic to Mount Fanjing, the main peak of the Wuling Mountains in China. It has a highly restricted distribution and limited population size, grows primarily in mosses within alpine dwarf forests, and is highly sensitive to environmental changes, facing a high risk of extinction. Artificially assisted conservation is essential to maintaining its population. To ensure the success of future biodiversity conservation strategies such as ex situ conservation and habitat restoration, we used high-throughput sequencing to profile endophytes within C. fanjingshanensis tissues and microbial communities inhabiting its moss substrate and associated water layer. We analyzed the characteristics of both endophytic and habitat-associated microbiota and their relationships, providing a basis for optimizing microbial-assisted artificial habitat simulation.We identified 177 core bacterial and 37 core fungal genera in the moss layer, and 87 bacterial and 50 fungal genera in the moss water layer. More beneficial bacteria and pathogenic fungi were enriched in moss water, whereas the moss layer exhibited a more complex and positively associated microbial network. The endophytic bacteria belonged to 42 phyla and 1,198 genera, showing significant differences in dominant genera and community diversity among root, stem, leaf, and tuber. In contrast, endophytic fungi belonged to 16 phyla and 943 genera, but their diversity remained relatively stable across tissues. The dominant shared core endophytic bacterial and fungal genera were primarily derived from the dominant microbial genera in the moss water layer.There were substantial differences in habitat microbial community. More beneficial bacteria and pathogenic fungi were enriched in the moss water layer. The moss layer exhibited a well-structured, positively associated microbial community, which may facilitate resistance to environmental stress. Among tissues, tubers harbored significantly higher diversity and richness of endophytic bacteria compared to other tissues. Endophytic fungal diversity and community structure remained relatively stable. Moss water microbes were an important source of endophytes. This study provides a reference for the development of artificially assisted conservation strategies for alpine narrow-range species represented by C. fanjingshanensis.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12870-025-07046-z.",

    "abstract": "An efficient in vitro propagation protocol for Eulophia bicallosa was developed using asymbiotic seed germination and protocorm proliferation. The effect of light on seed germination and development was evaluated on Vacin and Went (VW) medium under five conditions: darkness, white, green, red, and blue light for 24 weeks. Blue and red light significantly accelerated seed development, allowing progression to stage 5 within 24 weeks. For protocorm proliferation, six semi-solid culture media were tested. Half-strength Murashige and Skoog (½MS) medium yielded the best results after 8 weeks, producing the highest numbers of shoots (1.0), leaves (1.1), and roots (4.2) per protocorm, with 100% survival. The effects of organic additives were also evaluated using coconut water and potato extract. A combination of 200 mL L-1 coconut water and 50 g L-1 potato extract enhanced shoot formation (1.7 shoots), while 150 mL L-1 coconut water with 50 g L-1 potato extract increased both leaf (1.9) and root (8.8) numbers. The effects of cytokinins (benzyladenine (BA), kinetin (6-furfurylaminopurine), and thidiazuron (TDZ)) and auxins (indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)) were investigated using ½MS medium supplemented with each plant growth regulator individually at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg L-1. Among the cytokinins, 0.1 mg L-1 BA produced the highest survival rate (96%), while 1.0 mg L-1 BA induced the greatest shoot formation (93%, 2.3 shoots). Among the auxins, 0.1 mg L-1 IAA resulted in the highest survival (96%), and 1.0 mg L-1 IAA significantly enhanced root induction (4.2 roots per protocorm). Acclimatization in pots containing a 1:1:1 (v/v) mixture of pumice, sand, and soil resulted in 100% survival. This protocol provides a reliable and effective approach for the mass propagation and ex situ conservation of E. bicallosa.",

    "title": "Biochar-Coconut Shell Mixtures as Substrates for Phalaenopsis 'Big Chili'.",
    "abstract": "Phalaenopsis is a widely cultivated ornamental plant of considerable economic value worldwide. However, traditional growing medium, sphagnum moss, is limited and non-renewable. It also decomposes slowly and is prone to environmental issues. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify more environmentally friendly and efficient alternatives. Biochar, a sustainable material with excellent physical and chemical properties, has been recognized as an effective promoter of plant growth. In this study, we investigated the influence of biochar derived from three raw materials (corn straw, bamboo, and walnut) mixed1 with coconut shell at ratios of 1:2, 1:10, and 4:1, on the growth of Phalaenopsis 'Big Chili'. Over a 150-day controlled experiment, we evaluated multiple growth parameters, including plant height, crown width, total root length, total projected area, total surface area, and root volume. Compared to the traditional growing medium, the optimal biochar-coconut shell mixture (maize straw biochar: coconut shell = 1:2) increased plant height and crown width by 7.55% and 6.68%, respectively. Root metrics improved substantially, with total root length increasing by 10.96%, total projected area by 22.82%, total surface area by 22.14%, and root volume by 38.49%. Root biomass in the optimal treatment group increased by 42.47%, while aboveground and belowground dry weights increased by 6.16% and 77.11%, respectively. These improvements were closely associated with favorable substrate characteristics, including low bulk density, high total and water-holding porosity, moderate aeration, and adequate nutrient availability. These findings demonstrate that substrate characteristics critically influence plant performance and that biochar-coconut shell mixtures, particularly at a 1:2 ratio, represent a viable and sustainable alternative to sphagnum moss for commercial cultivation of Phalaenopsis.",

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Changnienia amoena is a rare and endangered terrestrial orchid endemic to China, valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties. However, limited genomic resources hinder its effective conservation strategies and sustainable utilization. This study aimed to generate comprehensive plastome resources and develop molecular markers to support the phylogenetics, identification, and conservation management of C. amoena. Methods: Genome skimming was employed to assemble and annotate the complete plastomes of seven geographically distinct C. amoena accessions. Comparative analyses were conducted to assess structural features and sequence divergence within C. amoena and across related species in the Calypsoinae subtribe. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred from protein-coding genes. Simple sequence repeats (SSRs), dispersed repeats, and hypervariable regions were identified from the plastomes, while nuclear SSRs were developed from assembled nuclear sequences. Results: All seven plastomes exhibited a conserved quadripartite structure with identical gene content and order, showing only minor variations in genome size. Sequence divergence was mainly confined to non-coding regions. Across Calypsoinae species, mycoheterotrophic taxa exhibited reduced plastomes. Phylogenetic analyses resolved four well-supported intergeneric clades within Calypsoinae and revealed a notable divergence between the HuNGZ accession and other C. amoena accessions, which otherwise showed low plastome-level differentiation. We also identified 69-74 plastome-derived SSRs, 22-25 dispersed repeats, and three hypervariable regions that may serve as informative molecular markers for C. amoena. Additionally, 16 polymorphic nuclear SSRs were developed from assembled nuclear sequences. Conclusions: These findings significantly expand the genomic resources available for C. amoena and provide essential insights for its phylogeny, molecular identification, conservation management, and future breeding efforts.",

    "title": "Epiphyte Vanilla relies on birds as long-distance seed dispersers.",
    "abstract": "Angiosperms comprise the most diverse group of land plants. While essentially sessile organisms, flowering plants can disperse their genes through pollen flow and expand their occurrence range by means of seed dispersal. While most orchids are anemophilous, seed dispersal in Vanilla is mediated by vertebrates. Here, I investigate processes involved in the attraction and rewarding of seed dispersers of an obligatory epiphytic Vanilla through field observations, analysis of fruit morphology, resource production, fragrance release, and seed viability. Dehiscent fruits of Vanilla lindmaniana are attractive exclusively to birds. The fruit cavity contains a mucilaginous substance rich in sugar, fat, protein, and starch, which is consumed by several bird species. The basal cells of the funiculi contain calcium oxalate crystals, which are harmful to mammals. Seed viability testing revealed that seeds germinate after passing through the bird digestive tract. This is the first study describing an obligatorily ornithochorous Vanilla. A mucilaginous substance produced by Vanilla fruits is consumed by diurnal birds, corroborating fruit features compatible with ornithochory. The presence of raphides in the funiculi cells also confirms that seed dispersal of V. lindmaniana is mediated exclusively by birds. Ornithochory is pivotal in the effective dispersal of seeds in obligate epiphytic Vanilla, as it ensures that consumed seeds are taken to other phorophytes through avian faeces, allowing gene flow and the colonization of new areas and environments.© 2025 Wiley‐VCH GmbH.

    "abstract": "Orchidaceae seeds are tiny and undeveloped, commonly facing difficulties in germination under natural conditions. Therefore, investigating seed germination of orchids is critically important. In this study, Bletilla striata seed germination was completed, the germination process was divided into six stages through morphological and histocytological observation, including ungerminated seeds (BS0), imbibition (BS1), formation of rhizoids (BS2), protocorm (BS3), radicle (BS4) and plumule (BS5). LC-MS analysis showed that ABA concentration increased and then decreased, while auxins and cytokinins concentration gradually decreased, and various carbohydrates contents gradually increased. Exogenous ABA treatment showed that ABA significantly inhibited the germination of B. striata. RNA-seq analysis found 323 genes were significantly differentially expressed during protocorms formation (p < 0.01), with more than 4-fold change. Two genes in ABA signaling pathway, BsPP2C17 and BsPP2C27, were upregulated by 30-fold and 60-fold, respectively. Heterologous expression in Arabidopsis showed that they could respectively revert the insensitivity to ABA of atap2c4 and atpp2c5 during seed germination, and the overexpression lines Col-OE-BsPP2C17 and Col-OE-BsPP2C27 exhibited hypersensitivity to ABA signals. These demonstrated that BsPP2C17 and BsPP2C27 were involved in the regulation of Arabidopsis seed germination as positive regulators of ABA signaling. These results provided a new perspective for the study of seed germination in Orchidaceae.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "The lower-extremity muscles are the main target of rehabilitation post-anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). This study aimed to investigate time-course changes in the cross-sectional area of lower-extremity muscles (MCSA) amongACLR patients.Twenty-seven male patients who underwent ACLRwere included and groupedintoPASS and non-PASS. PASS could achieve a ratio of injured-to-uninjured performance surpassing 90 % in all hop-tests and Lysholm score of ≥ 90. Those who failed to achieve even one of those conditions were designated as non-PASS. About MCSA, magnetic resonance images of the lower extremity on the injured side were obtained. Quadriceps, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and soleus were manually surroundedatthe slice featuredthe maximal MCSAfor each muscle. Range of motion (ROM) and muscle strength of the knee and anklewere measured. All parameters were measured before surgery (PRE) and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-ACLR(POST3/POST6/POST9/POST12, respectively). Knee stability was measured using KT-1000 in patients who underwent second-look surgery. The significance level was set at 5 %.At POST12, PASS (n = 14) exhibited greater ankle dorsiflexion ROM, knee extension strength, and ankle plantarflexion strength than non-PASS (n = 13). The interaction of MCSA was not detected, thus both data were integrated into a unified group for post-hoc tests.Quadriceps MCSA at POST12 was significantly larger than that at PRE. Hamstring, gastrocnemius, and soleusMCSAsat POST12did not have significant differences than those at PRE.Restoration of ankle function and strength may be important for returning to sports.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

    "abstract": "Orchid mycorrhizal (OM) symbiosis plays an essential role in orchid seed germination and development, but its molecular mechanisms remain largely unexplored.To comprehensively analyze gene expression associated with early fungal colonization, transcriptome analysis of Cypripedium macranthos var. rebunense was performed using mycorrhizal tissues prepared by inoculating seedling plants with a fungus that exhibited different mycorrhizal interaction properties among subcultures.Colonization with the mycorrhizal fungus induced an increased expression of orchid genes encoding enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis, degradation, and modification, as well as those encoding transporters of sugars, amino acids, nucleic acids, and other nitrogen-containing compounds. Enrichment analysis focusing on genes associated with protein-protein interactions (PPI) suggested a potential role of lectin domain-containing receptor-like kinases (LecRLKs) in the recognition of fungal colonization and the induction of cell wall-modifying enzymes and nutrient transporters required for mycorrhizal formation. Kinase genes such as MAPKKK and serine/threonine protein kinase were upregulated in tissues exhibiting continued peloton formation, whereas these genes exhibited no changes in tissues showing no peloton formation four weeks after inoculation.These results suggest that the continuous phosphorylation signaling cascade plays a crucial role in the regulatory pathway for maintaining mycorrhizal interactions between Cypripedium and its mycorrhizal fungus.Copyright © 2025 Jin, Kambara, Fujino and Shimura.",

    "abstract": "Combating illegal wildlife trade is a global conservation priority; yet, how social factors contribute to wildlife trade-especially of plants, including orchids-remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted in-person interviews with local people to explore their knowledge, perceptions, and socioeconomic factors associated with orchid trade. Generalized linear mixed models revealed that economic status, education, employment, occupation, perception, and knowledge were important factors influencing involvement in orchid trade. People who recognized orchids and engaged in farming were more likely to be involved in orchid trade. Conversely, those with sufficient food, employment, higher education, and perception that orchids are economically insignificant, were less likely to participate in orchid trade. These findings have implications for developing frameworks to address illegal trade of orchid and other taxa, especially in countries with shared ecological contexts where distribution of highly traded species often overlaps. This research recommends incorporation of social factors into effective conservation strategies.© 2025. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.",

    "abstract": "Edible orchids are increasingly threatened by unsustainable use in their natural habitats. Several studies highlight the need for propagation to counter this threat. However, a critical gap persists in understanding the environmental conditions that support these species in Malawi. This study aimed to identify potential habitats suitable for propagating edible orchids, focusing on Disa engleriana Kraenzl, 1893, to enhance ex situ conservation efforts. Present and future environmental data were sourced from WorldClim. Species occurrence data were obtained during field surveys and existing datasets. Using MaxEnt, continuous habitat suitability for D. engleriana was modeled based on presence-only occurrence data, Bioclim variables, and elevation. The integration of ArcGIS allowed for a detailed analysis, reclassifying the continuous suitability map into suitable and unsuitable habitats. The results of the study show that most suitable habitats align with the boundaries of protected areas, emphasizing their critical importance in conservation planning. The study further found that suitable habitats for D. engleriana are typically at altitudes between 1500 and 1600 m, with temperatures not exceeding 15°C during the wettest months. In addition to that, the results revealed the negative impact of climate change on habitat suitability, projecting a decrease in suitable areas over the next 50 years.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Plastics are integral to modern life but contribute significantly to environmental pollution due to their durability and low recycling rates. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is particularly problematic, representing a substantial portion of global plastic waste. Addressing this issue, this work presents a sustainable approach to upcycle PET into thermoplastic polyester elastomer (TPEE) films, integrated with orthogonal wavelength-controlled spiropyran derivatives, SP-COOH and MC-SO3. These upcycled TPEE films exhibit dynamic anticounterfeiting and photoswitchable conductivity properties. The spiropyran derivatives demonstrate reversible structural changes and color variations under different light conditions, enhancing their mechanical properties and solvent resistance. Inspired by the color changing of Hibiscus mutabilis, this work also demonstrates the artificial light-induced color on the petals of moth orchids. The incorporation of conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) further enables photoswitchable conductivity, offering a dual-layered security feature. This work not only advances polymer upcycling but also introduces innovative applications in anticounterfeiting and wearable technology, aligning with global sustainability goals and demonstrating the potential for high-value product development from waste materials.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "title": "StarNet: Indian star gooseberries dataset for quality and maturity assessment.",
    "abstract": "Star gooseberry provides immense health benefits and is widely recognized in the Indian medicinal system. It holds significant importance in the food production, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics industries due to the presence of therapeutic and pharmacological properties. Due to its beneficial properties, gooseberry fruit is widely used in treating various ailments. Therefore, cultivating these fruits presents an opportunity to generate revenue, benefiting both farmers and the agricultural sector. The post-harvest process of fruit typically performs the quality assessment by segregating fruits based on visual characteristics, which is tedious and prone to human error. Hence, there is a need to develop an automated computer vision model to assess the fruit quality more accurately. This study focuses on dataset collection, including image samples of both single and multiple-star gooseberry fruits to automate fruit grading. This dataset has been specifically developed for research purposes, contributing to fruit detection, quality assessment, weight estimation, and classification of fruits at various ripeness stages. Further, it provides researchers with an opportunity to develop an automated system for detecting overlapping fruits and touching contours using machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision systems. Image samples of star gooseberry at different growth stages were collected from orchids in Mysuru, India. The dataset, named \"AmlaNet\" comprises 792 image samples of star gooseberry, captured against a plain background from varying angles, sizes, brightness levels, and distances. The dataset is organized into four folders such as single star gooseberry fruit, multiple fruits, overlapped, and annotated samples of overlapped star gooseberry fruits including fruit samples with different ripeness stages. This publicly accessible dataset is expected to benefit the research community, enabling advancement in computer vision and AI Applications.

    "title": "An R2R3-MYB transcription factor regulates anthocyanin accumulation in response to temperature signals in Cymbidiumensifolium.",
    "abstract": "Cymbidium ensifolium, an ornamental plant in China, is prized for its diverse flower colors and high aesthetic value. The flower color of C. ensifolium is significantly affected by temperature. In this research, we examined the impact of temperature on anthocyanin accumulation in the sepals of C. ensifolium ('Shi Zhang Hong') through different temperature treatments (T1, 20/15 °C, T2, 28/23 °C, T3, 36/31 °C), combined with metabolomics, transcriptome analysis and various experimental methods, screening for key temperature-responsive genes. The results indicated that high temperatures suppress both red pigmentation and anthocyanin accumulation in sepals, while low temperatures promote this process. Metabolomic analysis indicated that temperature primarily influences sepal coloration by regulating the abundance of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside. Notably, its abundance significantly increases under low temperatures but decreases at high temperatures. CeMYB52 was found to be a crucial transcription factor (TF) regulating anthocyanin accumulation by transcriptome analysis, with high expression at low temperatures and low expression at high temperatures. Remarkably, the spatio-temporal expression profiles of CeCHS8 and CeGST were aligned with CeMYB52. Through regulating the expression of CeCHS8 and CeGST, CeMYB52 contributes significantly to the promotion of anthocyanin biosynthesis and transport. Our findings offer a molecular basis for breeding temperature-resilient ornamental plants, contributing to agricultural sustainability under climate change.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Masson SAS.

    "title": "Chemical composition of floral perfumes in Mormodes (Orchidaceae): implications for selective attraction of euglossine bees.",
    "abstract": "The genus Mormodes (Catasetinae) comprises ∼80 Neotropical orchid species, predominantly from the Amazon. Like other Catasetinae, these orchids offer floral perfumes as their sole reward to specialized pollinators - male euglossine bees (Apidae). Growing as epiphytes on tall, usually dead trees, Mormodes plants pose challenges for studying their natural history. Consequently, little is known about its pollinator interactions and perfume chemistry. Studies on related genera suggest that species-specific perfume blends are critical for attracting distinct euglossine species. Here, we present the first extensive ecological and chemical study of Mormodes, testing whether perfume variation is associated with differences in pollinator spectra and may function as a prezygotic reproductive barrier.Floral perfumes of ten species were collected via dynamic headspace and analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Floral visitors were captured on flowers in a region of high Mormodes diversity in the Amazon forest, northern Brazil.We identified 139 compounds in the floral perfumes of Mormodes spp., with species-specific profiles. While six species exhibited sesquiterpene-dominated bouquets, three species were dominated by aromatic compounds and one by monoterpenes. In the floral visitor survey, we reported ten species of Euglossa, four of Eulaema and one each of Exaerete, Aglae and Eufriesea. Some Mormodes species had exclusive pollinator spectra, while others shared pollinators.Unlike most Catasetinae perfumes, typically dominated by monoterpenes or aromatics, Mormodes perfumes are mostly sesquiterpene-based, a trend that may represent a third evolutionary trajectory within the subtribe. Species-specific chemical profiles were associated with distinct pollinator spectra, while similar bouquets resulted in pollinator sharing. These results highlight the key role of floral perfume chemistry in selective pollinator attraction and reproductive isolation. However, in species producing similar perfume chemistry and attracting the same pollinators, additional isolating mechanisms, such as floral morphology and phenology, might be required.© The Author(s) 2025.

    "abstract": "Neoscytalidium dimidiatum (Penz.) Crous & Slippers, a major pathogen affecting dragon fruit production globally, has also been documented causing diseases on economic or landscape crops in many countries. Despite the wide geographical distribution and host range of the pathogen, knowledge of the genetic and biological characteristics of N. dimidiatum from different spatiotemporal and host populations is limited. This study compared the phylogenetic and phenotypic diversity of the N. dimidiatum populations collected from dragon fruit between 2010 and 2021 in Taiwan with the isolates obtained from other hosts and countries. A multilocus sequence analysis revealed that the N. dimidiatum from Taiwan clustered based on their hosts, dragon fruit and cattleya, regardless of the spatiotemporal origins, whereas the isolates from other countries exhibited a slightly higher phylogenetic diversity. Limited phylogenetic diversity suggested that asexual reproduction may be the primary approach for N. dimidiatum to maintain the population in Taiwan. Nevertheless, variations in colony color, mycelial growth, and spore germination at different temperatures were evident within and among populations at different spatiotemporal scales. For instance, the population collected from dragon fruit in northwestern and eastern Taiwan had a significantly better mycelial growth rate at 40 ℃, compared to the populations collected from southwestern Taiwan. All tested isolates from different hosts were found to cause lesions on dragon fruit cladodes, however, generally larger lesions and significantly shorter latent periods were observed in the isolates collected from dragon fruit. The results suggested that phenotypic plasticity in clonal N. dimidiatum populations, along with a better fit in the original host, and the potential of infecting hosts that were under heat or other abiotic stresses may contribute to the global emergence of the pathogen.",

    "title": "Inside out: New root endophytic Penicillium and Talaromyces species isolated from Cattleya orchids (Orchidaceae) in Brazil.",
    "abstract": "The Orchidaceae family comprises a highly diverse group of flowering plants. The genus Cattleya is restricted to the Neotropics, with approximately 80 % of the species present in Brazil occurring in epiphytic, rupicolous, and terrestrial habitats. During surveys that aimed to investigate root fungal endophytes of two native orchids, C. locatellii and C. violacea, a total of 10 endophytic isolates were identified as belonging to Eurotiales. A polyphasic approach was applied for the identification and characterization of the cultured species, combining morphological and molecular data. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of the rDNA, beta-tubulin (BenA), calmodulin (CaM), and RNA polymerase second-largest subunit (RPB2) sequences. Two new endophytic species were identified and described from roots of C. locatellii, namely Penicillium endophyticum sp. nov. (section Aspergilloides), and Talaromyces cattleyae sp. nov. (section Purpurei). In addition, P. yuyongnianii (section Lanata-Divaricata), T. amestolkiae, and T. atkinsoniae (section Talaromyces) were reported as endophytes from the genus Cattleya.

    "title": "Efficiency of mycorrhizal fungi for seed germination and protocorms development of commercial Cattleya species (Orchidaceae).",
    "abstract": "Orchidaceae is one of the largest plant families and stands out for its wide variety of flowers with ornamental and environmental importance. Cattleya is one of the main commercial genera, presenting a great diversity of species and hybrids that attract the attention of collectors, orchid enthusiasts, and consumers. In their natural environment, orchids associate with mycorrhizal fungi, which are responsible for providing carbon and other nutrients during seed germination. This study investigated the potential of mycorrhizal fungi isolated from the genus Cattleya for in vitro symbiotic germination of seeds from three contrasting Cattleya species, comparing them with non-symbiotic germination in a commercially used culture medium for orchid propagation. The isolated fungi were molecularly identified through phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences using the ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) region. Three isolates obtained were identified as Tulasnella amonilioides, and through microscopic evaluations, the formation of monilioid cells was observed, a morphological characteristic previously unknown for this species. The T. amonilioides isolates were efficient in promoting seed germination of Cattleya bicolor, Cattleya walkeriana and Cattleya jongheana and accelerated the germination process when compared with the non-symbiotic commercial medium, showing to be promised for commercial seed production of these orchids species.© 2024.

    "abstract": "Bioinformatics-guided metabolomics is a powerful means for the discovery of novel natural products. However, the application of such metabologenomics approaches on microbial polyketides, a prominent class of natural products with diverse bioactivities, remains largely hindered due to our limited understanding on the mass spectrometry behaviors of these metabolites. Here, we present a metabologenomics approach for the targeted discovery of polyketides biosynthesized by modular type I polyketide synthases. We developed the NegMDF workflow, which uses mass defect filtering (MDF) supported by bioinformatic structural prediction, to connect the biosynthetic gene clusters to corresponding metabolite ions obtained under negative ionization mode. The efficiency of the NegMDF workflow is illustrated by rapid characterization of 22 polyketides synthesized by three gene clusters from a well-characterized strain Streptomyces cattleya NRRL 8057, including cattleyatetronates, new members of polyketides containing a rare tetronate moiety. Our results showcase the effectiveness of the MDF-based metabologenomics workflow for analyzing microbial natural products, and will accelerate the genome mining of microbial polyketides.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

    "abstract": "Widely produced and marketed worldwide, orchids suffers from several diseases that have a negative effect on production. Black rot disease is among the most common and severe disease, characterized by black spots of rot on leaves, pseudobulbs and roots, which usually lead to the plant death. The world literature lists some Phytophthora species as causal agents of the disease, but there is no advanced study on the etiology of this disease in Brazil, which makes it difficult to determine an efficient control method. This work aims to contribute to the study of the etiology of black rot on Cattleya leopoldii in Brazil. Severely diseased C. leopoldii plants with typical symptoms of black rot, collected from a commercial orchid farm in Brazil, were taken to the laboratory and used to isolate the pathogen. Based on morphological characters analysis combined with molecular data, the isolates were identified as belonging to the species Phytophthora heterospora. This is the first worldwide report of P. heterospora causing black rot disease on orchids.© 2024. The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the influence of culture media, irradiance, and sealing system on the in vitro and ex vitro growth of Cattleya walkeriana Gardner. We used MS medium as culture medium, supplemented with 30 g L-1 of sucrose and solidified with 7.0 g L-1 of bacteriological agar. This medium served as a control, while for the other treatments we supplemented the media as follows: 2) MS with 150 g L-1 of banana pulp = P150; 3) MS with 300 g L-1 of banana pulp = P300; 4) MS with 150 g L-1 of banana peel = PE150; and 5) MS with 300 g L-1 of banana peel = PE300. The irradiances were provided by 3000K LED lamps: 86 μmol m-2 s-1 (Irradiance-1) and 128 µmol m-2 s-1 (Irradiance-2) and the conventional sealing (CSS) and sealing systems that allow gas exchange (GESS). After 120 (in vitro) and 180 days (ex vitro) of cultivation, we evaluated them for pseudobulb (PN), leaf (LN) and root number (RN), plant height (PH), pseudobulb diameter (PD), longest leaf (LL) and root length (RL), fresh mass (TFM) and survival (%SURV). There was a significant interaction for all the variables analyzed. The CM x SS double interaction was significant for PH, LL, and RL. The CM x I x SS interaction was significant for PN, LN, RN, PD, TFM, and %SURV traits of C. walkeriana grown in vitro. There was a significant interaction between CM x I x SS for all C. walkeriana traits evaluated in ex vitro culture. Using the medium with up to 150 g L-1 of banana pulp combined with Irradiance-2 and CSS provided the highest values for in vitro plant growth. However, prior cultivation in MS medium, Irradiance-1, and CSS provided the greatest survival and establishment of this species plants in ex vitro culture.",

    "title": "Molecular characterisation of a novel sadwavirus infecting cattleya orchids in Australia.",
    "abstract": "The complete genome sequence of a novel sadwavirus infecting cattleya orchids in South East Queensland is described. Isometric virions of c. 27 nm diameter were observed in sap extracts viewed under a transmission electron microscope, and the genome sequence of this virus was determined by high-throughput sequencing. The viral genome consists of two RNA components, 5,910 and 4,435 nucleotides (nt) in length, each encoding a long polyprotein, with predicted cleavage sites at H/Y, E/G, Q/S, and Q/G for the RNA1 and T/G for the RNA2 translation products, respectively. RNA2 has an additional small ORF of 684 nt near the 3' untranslated region. Phylogenetic analysis based on an amino acid sequence alignment of the Pro-Pol region suggested that this virus is most closely related to pineapple secovirus A, a member of the subgenus Cholivirus, but warrants classification as a member of a new species because it exhibited no more than 64% amino acid identity in pairwise sequence comparisons. Because of the prominent purple ringspots that were observed on the leaves of some of the plants, we propose the name \"cattleya purple ringspot virus\" for this virus (suggested species name: \"Sadwavirus cattleyacola\").© 2024.

    "title": "Orchid seeds are not always short lived in a conventional seed bank!",
    "abstract": "Orchid seeds are reputed to be short lived in dry, cold storage conditions, potentially limiting the use of conventional seed banks for long-term ex situ conservation. This work explores whether Cattleya seeds are long lived or not during conventional storage (predried to ~12 % relative humidity, then stored at -18 °C).We explored the possible interaction of factors influencing seed lifespan in eight species of the genus Cattleya using physiological (germination and vigour), biochemical (gas chromatography), biophysical (differential scanning calorimetry) and morphometric methods. Seeds were desiccated to ~3 % moisture content and stored at -18 °C for more than a decade, and seed quality was measured via three in vitro germination techniques. Tetrazolium staining was also used to monitor seed viability during storage. The morphometric and germination data were subjected to ANOVA and cluster analysis, and seed lifespan was subjected to probit analysis.Seeds of all Cattleya species were found to be desiccation tolerant, with predicted storage lifespans (P50y) of ~30 years for six species and much longer for two species. Cluster analysis showed that the three species with the longest-lived seeds had smaller (9-11 %) airspaces around the embryo. The post-storage germination method impacted the quality assessment; seeds equilibrated at room temperature for 24 h or in 10 % sucrose solution had improved germination, particularly for the seeds with the smallest embryos. Chromatography revealed that the seeds of all eight species were rich in linoleic acid, and differential scanning calorimetry identified a peak that might be auxiliary to selecting long-lived seeds.These findings show that not all orchids produce seeds that are short lived, and our trait analyses might help to strengthen prediction of seed longevity in diverse orchid species.© The Author(s) 2024.

    "title": "Nectar-mediated avian pollination in Cattleya (Orchidaceae: Laeliinae).",
    "abstract": "Orchids are notable for the variety of rewards produced for their pollinators. Nevertheless, many species are rewardless and pollinated by food-deceptive strategies. This is the case for Cattleya, a Neotropical genus of more than 100 species supposedly pollinated by food-deception. Here, I studied a member of the clade Sophronitis (Cattleya cernua) in forest areas of southeastern Brazil. The study included analyses of floral morphology, light microscopy of secretory tissues, histochemistry of flower resources, and measurements of nectar volume and concentration. Data on pollinators and mechanisms of pollination were collected in the field by means of film records, while breeding systems were studied using experimental treatments applied to cultivated specimens. The flower traits of Cattleya cernua show strong adaptation to avian pollination. Flowers produce 1-7 μl of a moderately concentrated nectar (17-50%). A secretory tissue at the distal portion of the cuniculus is responsible for nectar secretion. Secreted nectar is stored in the nectar chamber. Pollinaria deposition on the apex of bird beaks allows both short- and long-billed birds to pollinate the flowers. Plants from the studied population were fully self-compatible but pollinator-dependent. Pollinator frequency was higher than in food-deceptive Cattleya. As far as is known, this is the first record of nectar production in Cattleya. The discovery of a reward-producing species (C. cernua) within a genus entirely pollinated by food-deception strategies (Cattleya) provides clues and new insights into understanding the diversification of Laeliinae across the Neotropics.© 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

In addition to this, the crude extract and its main fractions were analysed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS), leading to the putative identification of several other compounds, including flavonoids and organic acids derivatives.

    "abstract": "Epidendrum, one of the three largest genera of Orchidaceae, exhibits significant horticultural and ornamental value and serves as an important research model in conservation, ecology, and evolutionary biology. Given the ambiguous identification of germplasm and complex evolutionary relationships within the genus, the complete plastome of this genus (including five species) were firstly sequenced and assembled to explore their characterizations. The plastomes exhibited a typical quadripartite structure. The lengths of the plastomes ranged from 147,902 bp to 150,986 bp, with a GC content of 37.16% to 37.33%. Gene annotation revealed the presence of 78-82 protein-coding genes, 38 tRNAs, and 8 rRNAs. A total of 25-38 long repeats and 130-149 SSRs were detected. Analysis of relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) indicated that leucine (Leu) was the most and cysteine (Cys) was the least. The consistent and robust phylogenetic relationships of Epidendrum and its closely related taxa were established using a total of 43 plastid genomes from the tribe Epidendreae. The genus Epidendrum was supported as a monophyletic group and as a sister to Cattleya. Meanwhile, four mutational hotspots (trnCGCA-petN, trnDGUC-trnYGUA, trnSGCU-trnGUCC, and rpl32-trnLUAG) were identified for further phylogenetic studies. Our analysis demonstrates the promising utility of plastomes in inferring the phylogenetic relationships of Epidendrum.",

    "title": "Identification of an indole biodegradation gene cluster from Providencia rettgeri and its contribution in selectively biosynthesizing Tyrian purple.",
    "abstract": "Tyrian purple, mainly composed of 6, 6'-dibromoindigo, is a precious dye extracted from sea snails. In this study, we found Tyrian purple can be selectively produced by a bacterial strain GS-2 when fed with 6-bromotryptophan in the presence of tryptophan. This GS-2 strain was then identified as Providencia rettgeri based on bacterial genome sequencing analysis. An indole degradation gene cluster for indole metabolism was identified from this GS-2 strain. The heterologous expression of the indole degradation gene cluster in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and in vitro enzymatic reaction demonstrated that the indole biodegradation gene cluster may contribute to selectively biosynthesizing Tyrian purple. To further explore the underlying mechanism of the selectivity, we explored the intermediates in this indole biodegradation pathway using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS), which indicated that the indole biodegradation pathway in Providencia rettgeri is the catechol pathway. Interestingly, the monooxygenase GS-C co-expressed with its corresponding reductase GS-D in the cluster has better activity for the biosynthesis of Tyrian purple compared with the previously reported monooxygenase from Methylophaga aminisulfidivorans (MaFMO) or Streptomyces cattleya cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP102G4). This is the first study to show the existence of an indole biodegradation pathway in Providencia rettgeri, and the indole biodegradation gene cluster can contribute to the selective production of Tyrian purple.Copyright © 2023 Li, Deng, Zhong, Ruan, Zhao and Luo.",

    "abstract": "Orchid flowers have a unique structure that consists of three sepals and three petals, with one of the petals forming the labellum (lip) that can be differentiated into the hypochile and epichile. In orchids, the emission of floral scent is specific and spatially complex. Little is understood about the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of the differing scent emissions between the parts of orchid flowers. Here, we investigated this in the Cattleya hybrid KOVA, and our study showed that monoterpenes, including linalool and geraniol, are the main components responsible for the KOVA floral scent. The KOVA flower was scentless to the human nose before it reached full bloom, potentially because the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthases (RcDXSs) and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate synthases (RcHDSs) that biosynthesize monoterpenes were highly expressed in flowers only when it reached full flowering. Additionally, the spatial expression profile of the monoterpene synthases (RcMTPSs), which were highly expressed in the basal region of the lip (hypochile), contributed to the highest monoterpene emissions from this part of the flower. This might have caused the hypochile to be more fragrant than the other parts of the flower. These findings enrich our understanding of the difference in scents between different flower parts in plants and provide information to breed novel orchid cultivars with special floral scents.",

    "title": "In Vitro Polyploidization of Brassolaeliocattleya Hybrid Orchid.",
    "abstract": "The Cattleya (Orchidaceae-Laeliinae subtribe) intergeneric hybrids, such as Brassolaeliocattleya (Blc.), have great ornamental value, due to their compact-size, with large and high color diversity of flowers. Artificial induction of polyploidy brings agronomic, ornamental and genetic benefits to plants. Polyploidization efficiency depends on factors, such as the type of antimitotic, polyploidization method, concentrations, exposure times and type of explant. This study aimed to develop a protocol to polyploidize Blc. orchids, by testing two types of explants (seeds and protocorms), concentrations and exposure times to colchicine. The effects of colchicine on the in vitro development of explants were also investigated. The responses of explants to colchicine depended on the concentrations, exposure time and the interaction of these factors. Flow cytometric analysis evidenced high endopolyploidy and allowed the separation of polyploidized (4C, 8C and 16C peaks) from non-polyploidized (only 2C and 4C peaks) plants. The highest percentage of polyploid plants was regenerated from protocorms (16.4%) treated with colchicine instead of seeds (3.2%). Protocorms treated with colchicine at 500-750 μM for 18 h resulted in the best percentage of polyploidization. Additionally, in vitro natural polyploidization using protocorms was reported (11.5%). Cytological analyses allowed an estimation of the number of chromosomes of the parents (≡70), polyploidized (≡140) and non-polyploidized progeny (≡70).",

    "abstract": "The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics approach is a powerful technology for discovering novel biologically active molecules. In this study, we investigated the metabolic profiling of Orchidaceae species using LC-HRMS/MS data combined with chemometric methods and dereplication tools to discover antifungal compounds. We analyze twenty ethanolic plant extracts from Vanda and Cattleya (Orchidaceae) genera. Molecular networking and chemometric methods were used to discriminate ions that differentiate healthy and fungal-infected plant samples. Fifty-three metabolites were rapidly annotated through spectral library matching and in silico fragmentation tools. The metabolomic profiling showed a large production of polyphenols, including flavonoids, phenolic acids, chromones, stilbenoids, and tannins, which varied in relative abundance across species. Considering the presence and abundance of metabolites in both groups of samples, we can infer that these constituents are associated with biochemical responses to microbial attacks. In addition, we evaluated the metabolic dynamic through the synthesis of stilbenoids in fungal-infected plants. The tricin derivative flavonoid- and the loliolide terpenoidfound only in healthy plant samples, are promising antifungal metabolites. LC-HRMS/MS, combined with state-of-the-art tools, proved to be a rapid and reliable technique for fingerprinting medicinal plants and discovering new hits and leads.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the efficacy of cinnamon extract as an anti-insomnia medication in experimental animals by evaluating the levels of hormones and neurotransmitters related to insomnia.A total of 30 male Wistar rats were divided into six groups. Induction of insomnia in animal models was done by administration of p-chloro-phenylalanine (PCPA) compounds. Estazolam was administrated to the positive control group. Cinnamon extract administration was divided into 3 doses, namely: 25 mg/kg BW, 50 mg/kg BW and 100 mg/kg BW. Evaluation of the organ coefficient was conducted to evaluate drug toxicity to the organs. The enzyme-linked-immunoassay method assessed hormones and neurotransmitters in the serum and hypothalamus related to insomnia.There was a decrease in the adrenal coefficient in the cinnamon extract group compared to the PCPA group (0.011+0.001, P<0.05). In addition, there was a decrease in the corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropin hormone, and corticosterone levels in the serum of animals who received cinnamon extract. Our study found a dose of cinnamon extract of 50 mg/kg BW was the best dose to balance neurotransmitter levels in insomniac rats.The cinnamon extract increased serotonin and melatonin levels and decreased norepinephrine levels in the insomnia-induced group. Cinnamon extract has potential as an anti-insomnia medication through hypothalamus-pituitaryadrenal axis improvement and brain neurotransmitter regulation in an animal model of insomnia.Copyright © 2022 by Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.",

    "abstract": "The enzyme BesC from the β-ethynyl-l-serine biosynthetic pathway in Streptomyces cattleya fragments 4-chloro-l-lysine (produced from l-Lysine by BesD) to ammonia, formaldehyde, and 4-chloro-l-allylglycine and can analogously fragment l-Lys itself. BesC belongs to the emerging family of O2-activating non-heme-diiron enzymes with the \"heme-oxygenase-like\" protein fold (HDOs). Here, we show that the binding of l-Lys or an analogue triggers capture of O2 by the protein's diiron(II) cofactor to form a blue μ-peroxodiiron(III) intermediate analogous to those previously characterized in two other HDOs, the olefin-installing fatty acid decarboxylase, UndA, and the guanidino-N-oxygenase domain of SznF. The ∼5- and ∼30-fold faster decay of the intermediate in reactions with 4-thia-l-Lys and (4RS)-chloro-dl-lysine than in the reaction with l-Lys itself and the primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects (D-KIEs) on decay of the intermediate and production of l-allylglycine in the reaction with 4,4,5,5-[2H4]-l-Lys suggest that the peroxide intermediate or a reversibly connected successor complex abstracts a hydrogen atom from C4 to enable olefin formation. Surprisingly, the sluggish substrate l-Lys can dissociate after triggering intermediate formation, thereby allowing one of the better substrates to bind and react. The structure of apo BesC and the demonstrated linkage between Fe(II) and substrate binding suggest that the triggering event involves an induced ordering of ligand-providing helix 3 (α3) of the conditionally stable HDO core. As previously suggested for SznF, the dynamic α3 also likely initiates the spontaneous degradation of the diiron(III) product cluster after decay of the peroxide intermediate, a trait emerging as characteristic of the nascent HDO family.",

    "abstract": "Orchid seeds are reputed to be relatively short-lived, although comparative studies across a wide range of storage temperatures and moisture contents are few.To explore how a wide range of temperature and moisture contents affects seed longevity in the orchid genus Cattleya.Seeds of three Brazilian orchid species in the genus Cattleya (C. amethystoglossa, C. kautskyana and C. tigrina) were subjected to controlled deterioration (CD) and seeds at three moisture levels were stored for up to 270 days at temperatures as low as -196 degree C. Seed ageing curves were constructed and seed quality assessed as germination level and speed index in vitro, and by tetrazolium staining. Seed morphometry, lipid content and composition were also determined.Seeds were found to be lipid rich (54-70% DW) and short-lived under CD, with P50s varying less than two-fold (42 to 69 h) at 41 degree C. At cold (5 degree C) to ultracold (-196 degree C) temperatures longevity was greatest after pre-drying seeds to 15% RH, with germination varying by c. 6% after 270 days storage at these temperature limits. However, storage at -20 degree C resulted in a 5-46% reduction in germination, indicating a dry-seed sensitivity to conventional seed bank temperature. Ultra-dry (silica gel) and high humidity (82% RH) storage, in combination with various temperatures, compromised viability in one or more species. Overall, seed longevity in C. kautskyana > C. tigrina > C. amethystoglossa, which also reflected the pattern of embryo volume. The prospect that the generally shorter lifespans in orchid seeds may relate to stochastic processes the negative impact of which reach criticality sooner in smaller embryos requires further testing.Further evidence is provided that cryobiotechnology provides a biobanking option for orchid seeds with relatively short lifespans.",

    "abstract": "The caseinolytic protease (ClpP) is part of a highly conserved proteolytic complex whose disruption can lead to antibacterial activity but for which few specific inhibitors have been discovered. Specialized metabolites produced by bacteria have been shaped by evolution for specific functions, making them a potential source of selective ClpP inhibitors. Here, we describe a target-directed genome mining strategy for discovering ClpP-interacting compounds by searching for biosynthetic gene clusters that contain duplicated copies of ClpP as putative antibiotic resistance genes. We identify a widespread family of ClpP-associated clusters that are known to produce pyrrolizidine alkaloids but whose connection to ClpP has never been made. We show that previously characterized molecules do not affect ClpP function but are shunt metabolites derived from the genuine product of these gene clusters, a reactive covalent ClpP inhibitor. Focusing on one such cryptic gene cluster from Streptomyces cattleya, we identify the relevant inhibitor, which we name clipibicyclene, and show that it potently and selectively inactivates ClpP. Finally, we solve the crystal structure of clipibicyclene-modified Escherichia coli ClpP. Clipibicyclene's discovery reveals the authentic function of a family of natural products whose specificity for ClpP and abundance in nature illuminate the role of eco-evolutionary forces during bacterial competition.© 2022.

    "abstract": "Streptomyces linear plasmids often contain an internal replication origin. In this study, a new replication origin was identified and confirmed in the 1.8-Mb plasmid pSCATT of Streptomyces cattleya DSM46488. The real-time qPCR results indicated that the copy number of pSCATT was one copy per chromosome. The identified replication origin oriC1-II was found to locate in the central region of pSCATT and was 2 kb in size. This replication origin consists of a protein-coding gene SCATT_p08010 with an unknown function and the upstream non-coding sequence. Deletion or disruption analysis of SCATT_p08010 or the upstream non-coding sequence revealed that both SCATT_p08010 and the non-coding sequence were essential for replication. However, the identified replication origin was shown to endow the plasmid with the ability to replicate in a circular model but not in a linear model in S. lividans. Interestingly, the knockout of the replication origin did not result in the curing of pSCATT, indicating that there might be other replication origins present in the mega-plasmid. The experimental validation of the central replication origin oriC1-II might be helpful for the investigation of the replication mechanism of the mega-plasmid and the genome evolution of Streptomyces.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier GmbH.

This process is a critical step for a biosynthetic pathway that generates a terminal alkyne amino acid which can be leveraged as a useful bio-orthogonal handle for protein labeling. As a member of an emerging family of diiron enzymes that are typified by their heme oxygenase-like fold and a very similar set of coordinating ligands, recently termed HDOs, BesC performs an unusual type of carbon-carbon cleavage reaction that is a significant departure from reactions catalyzed by canonical dinuclear-iron enzymes. Here, we show that BesC activates O2 in a substrate-gated manner to generate a diferric-peroxo intermediate. Examination of the reactivity of the peroxo intermediate with a series of lysine derivatives demonstrates that BesC initiates this unique reaction trajectory via cleavage of the C4-H bond; this process represents the rate-limiting step in a single turnover reaction. The observed reactivity of BesC represents the first example of a dinuclear-iron enzyme that utilizes a diferric-peroxo intermediate to capably cleave a C-H bond as part of its native function, thus circumventing the formation of a high-valent intermediate more commonly associated with substrate monooxygenations.",

Chemically modified into imipenem (N-formimidoyl thienamycin), now one of the most clinically important antibiotics, thienamycin is encoded by a thienamycin gene cluster composed of 22 genes (thnA to thnV) from S. cattleya NRRL 8057 genome. Interestingly, the role of all thn-genes has been experimentally demonstrated in the thienamycin biosynthesis, except thnS, despite its annotation as putative β-lactamase. Here, we expressed thnS gene and investigated its activities against various substrates. Our analyses revealed that ThnS belonged to the superfamily of metallo-β-lactamase fold proteins. Compared to known β-lactamases such as OXA-48 and NDM-1, ThnS exhibited a lower affinity and less efficiency toward penicillin G and cefotaxime, while imipenem is more actively hydrolysed. Moreover, like most MBL fold enzymes, additional enzymatic activities of ThnS were detected such as hydrolysis of ascorbic acid, single strand DNA, and ribosomal RNA. ThnS appears as a MBL enzyme with multiple activities including a specialised β-lactamase activity toward imipenem. Thus, like toxin/antitoxin systems, the role of thnS gene within the thienamycin gene cluster appears as an antidote against the produced thienamycin.",

Thus, some of the structural details have yet to be characterized, and little is known about their full distribution among bacterial strains and specifically within potential Gram-positive polysaccharide utilization loci.

Although this C-terminal cap is not widely distributed throughout the GH5_18 family, it is important for full enzyme activity.

    "title": "Intrafloral Color Modularity in a Bee-Pollinated Orchid.",
    "abstract": "Flower color has been studied in different ecological levels of organization, from individuals to communities. However, it is unclear how color is structured at the intrafloral level. In bee-pollinated flowers, the unidirectional gradient in color purity and pollen mimicry are two common processes to explain intrafloral color patterns. Considering that floral traits are often integrated, usually reflecting evolutionary modules under pollinator-mediated selection, we hypothesize that such intrafloral color patterns are structured by intrafloral color modules as perceived by bee color vision system. Here, we studied the tropical bee-pollinated orchid Cattleya walkeriana, given its intrafloral color complexity and variation among individuals. Considering bee color vision, we investigated if intrafloral color modules arose among intrafloral patches (tip or base of the sepals, petals, and labellum). We expected a separate color module between the labellum patches (the main attractive structure in orchids) and petals and sepals. We measured the color reflectance and calculated the photoreceptor excitation, spectral purity, hue, and the chromatic contrast of the floral structures in the hexagon color model. Spectral purity (saturation) was higher in the labellum tip in comparison to petals and sepals, generating a unidirectional gradient. Labellum base presented a less saturated yellow UV-absorbing color, which may reflect a pollen mimicry strategy. C. walkeriana presented three intrafloral color modules corresponding to the color of petals and sepals, the color of the labellum tip, and the color of labellum base. These color modules were unrelated to the development of floral structures. Given the importance of intrafloral color patterns in bee attraction and guidance, our results suggest that intrafloral patterns could be the outcome of evolutionary color modularization under pollinator-mediated selection.Copyright © 2020 Aguiar, Maciel, Santana, Telles, Bergamo, Oliveira and Brito.",

The genetic inactivation of key biosynthetic genes involved in the fluorometabolisms in MA37 resulted in the increased accumulation of unidentified fluorometabolites as observed from 19F-NMR spectral comparison among the wild type (WT) of MA37 and the mutated variants, providing evidence of the presence of other new biosynthetic enzymes involved in the fluorometabolite pathway in MA37.",

    "title": "The Dark Side of Orchid Symbiosis: Can Tulasnella calospora Decompose Host Tissues?",
    "abstract": "Photosynthetic orchids associate with mycorrhizal fungi that can be mostly ascribed to the \"rhizoctonia\" species complex. Rhizoctonias' phylogenetic diversity covers a variety of ecological/nutritional strategies that include, beside the symbiosis establishment with host plants, endophytic and pathogenic associations with non-orchid plants or saprotrophic soil colonization. In addition, orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) that establish a symbiotic relationship with an orchid host can later proliferate in browning and rotting orchid tissues. Environmental triggers and molecular mechanisms governing the switch leading to either a saprotrophic or a mycorrhizal behavior in OMF remain unclear. As the sequenced OMF genomes feature a wide range of genes putatively involved in the degradation of plant cell wall (PCW) components, we tested if these transitions may be correlated with a change in the expression of some PCW degrading enzymes. Regulation of several genes encoding PCW degrading enzymes was evaluated during saprotrophic growth of the OMF Tulasnella calospora on different substrates and under successful and unsuccessful mycorrhizal symbioses. Fungal gene expression in planta was investigated in two orchid species, the terrestrial Mediterranean Serapias vomeracea and the epiphytic tropical Cattleya purpurata. Although we only tested a subset of the CAZyme genes identified in the T. calospora genome, and we cannot exclude therefore a role for different CAZyme families or members inside a family, the results showed that the degradative potential of T. calospora is finely regulated during saprotrophic growth and in symbiosis, often with a different regulation in the two orchid species. These data pose novel questions about the role of fungal PCW degrading enzymes in the development of unsuccessful and successful interactions.",

    "abstract": "β-Hydroxy-α-amino acids (βH-AAs) are key components of many bioactive molecules as well as exist as specialised metabolites. Among these βH-AAs, 4-fluorothreonine (4-FT) is the only naturally occurring fluorinated AA discovered thus far. Here we report overexpression and biochemical characterisation of 4-fluorothreonine transaldolase from Streptomyces sp. MA37 (FTaseMA), a homologue of FTase previously identified in the biosynthesis of 4-FT in S. cattleya. FTaseMA displays considerable substrate plasticity to generate 4-FT as well as other β-hydroxy-α-amino acids with various functionalities at C4 position, giving the prospect of new chemo-enzymatic applications. The enzyme has a hybrid of two catalytic domains, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (S) and aldolase (A). Site-directed mutagenesis allowed the identification of the key residues of FTases, suggesting that the active site of A domain has a historical reminiscent feature in metal-dependent aldolases. Elemental analysis demonstrated that FTaseMA is indeed a Zn2+-dependent enzyme, the first example of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) enzyme family fused with a metal-binding domain carrying out a distinct catalytic role. Finally, FTaseMA showed divergent evolutionary origin with other PLP dependent enzymes.",

    "abstract": "An unbalanced pigment distribution among the sepal and petal segments results in various colour patterns of orchid flowers. Here, we explored this type of mechanism of colour pattern formation in flowers of the Cattleya hybrid 'KOVA'. Our study showed that pigment accumulation displayed obvious spatiotemporal specificity in the flowers and was likely regulated by three R2R3-MYB transcription factors. Before flowering, RcPAP1 was specifically expressed in the epichile to activate the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, which caused substantial cyanin accumulation and resulted in a purple-red colour. After flowering, the expression of RcPAP2 resulted in a low level of cyanin accumulation in the perianths and a pale pink colour, whereas RcPCP1 was expressed only in the hypochile, where it promoted α-carotene and lutein accumulation and resulted in a yellow colour. Additionally, we propose that the spatiotemporal expression of different combinations of AP3- and AGL6-like genes might participate in KOVA flower colour pattern formation.",

    "abstract": "L-Hydroxyproline (Hyp) is a valuable intermediate for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals; consequently, a practical process for its production has been in high demand. To date, industrial processes have been developed by using L-Pro hydroxylases. However, a process for the synthesis of trans-3-Hyp has not yet been established, because of the lack of highly selective enzymes that can convert L-Pro to trans-3-Hyp. The present study was designed to develop a biocatalytic trans-3-Hyp production process. We speculated that ectoine hydroxylase (EctD), which is involved in the hydroxylation of the known compatible solute ectoine, may possess the ability to hydroxylate L-Pro, since the structures of ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine resemble those of L-Pro and trans-3-Hyp, respectively. Consequently, we discovered that ectoine hydroxylases from Halomonas elongata, as well as some actinobacteria, catalyzed L-Pro hydroxylation to form trans-3-Hyp. Of these, ectoine hydroxylase from Streptomyces cattleya also utilized 3,4-dehydro-L-Pro, 2-methyl-L-Pro, and L-pipecolic acid as substrates. In the whole-cell bioconversion of L-Pro into trans-3-Hyp using Escherichia coli expressing the ectD gene from S. cattleya, only 12.4 mM trans-3-Hyp was produced from 30 mM L-Pro, suggesting a rapid depletion of 2-oxoglutarate, an essential component of enzyme activity as a cosubstrate, in the host. Therefore, the endogenous 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase gene was deleted. Using this deletion mutant as the host, trans-3-Hyp production was enhanced up to 26.8 mM from 30 mM L-Pro, with minimal loss of 2-oxoglutarate. This finding is not only beneficial for trans-3-Hyp production, but also for other E. coli bioconversion processes involving 2-oxoglutarate-utilizing enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Living systems can generate an enormous range of cellular functions, from mechanical infrastructure and signalling networks to enzymatic catalysis and information storage, using a notably limited set of chemical functional groups. This observation is especially notable when compared to the breadth of functional groups used as the basis for similar functions in synthetically derived small molecules and materials. The relatively small cross-section between biological and synthetic reactivity space forms the foundation for the development of bioorthogonal chemistry, in which the absence of a pair of reactive functional groups within the cell allows for a selective in situ reaction1-4. However, biologically 'rare' functional groups, such as the fluoro5, chloro6,7, bromo7,8, phosphonate9, enediyne10,11, cyano12, diazo13, alkene14 and alkyne15-17 groups, continue to be discovered in natural products made by plants, fungi and microorganisms, which offers a potential route to genetically encode the endogenous biosynthesis of bioorthogonal reagents within living organisms. In particular, the terminal alkyne has found broad utility via the Cu(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition 'click' reaction18. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a unique pathway to produce a terminal alkyne-containing amino acid in the bacterium Streptomyces cattleya. We found that L-lysine undergoes an unexpected reaction sequence that includes halogenation, oxidative C-C bond cleavage and triple bond formation through a putative allene intermediate. This pathway offers the potential for de novo cellular production of halo-, alkene- and alkyne-labelled proteins and natural products from glucose for a variety of downstream applications.",

Little is known regarding the evolution of these gene lineages in non-core eudicots, and there are no reports on gene expression that can be used to assess whether the network predates the diversification of core eudicots.Homologs of the RAD and DIV lineages were isolated from available genomes and transcriptomes, including those of three selected non-core eudicot species, the magnoliid Aristolochia fimbriata and the monocots Cattleya trianae and Hypoxis decumbens. Phylogenetic analyses for each gene lineage were performed. RT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression and putative contribution to floral symmetry in dissected floral organs of the selected species.RAD-like genes have undergone at least two duplication events before eudicot diversification, three before monocots and at least four in Orchidaceae. DIV-like genes also duplicated twice before eudicot diversification and underwent independent duplications specific to Orchidaceae. RAD-like and DIV-like genes have differential dorsiventral expression only in C. trianae, which contrasts with the homogeneous expression in the perianth of A. fimbriata.Our results point to a common genetic regulatory network for floral symmetry in monocots and core eudicots, while alternative genetic mechanisms are likely driving the bilateral perianth symmetry in the early-diverging angiosperm Aristolochia.© 2019 Botanical Society of America.",

    "abstract": "Fluorinated small molecules play an important role in the design of bioactive compounds for a broad range of applications. As such, there is strong interest in developing a deeper understanding of how fluorine affects the interaction of these ligands with their targets. Given the small number of fluorinated metabolites identified to date, insights into fluorine recognition have been provided almost entirely by synthetic systems. The fluoroacetyl-CoA thioesterase (FlK) from Streptomyces cattleya thus provides a unique opportunity to study an enzyme-ligand pair that has been evolutionarily optimized for a surprisingly high 106 selectivity for a single fluorine substituent. In these studies, we synthesize a series of analogs of fluoroacetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA to generate nonhydrolyzable ester, amide, and ketone congeners of the thioester substrate to isolate the role of fluorine molecular recognition in FlK selectivity. Using a combination of thermodynamic, kinetic, and protein NMR experiments, we show that fluorine recognition is entropically driven by the interaction of the fluorine substituent with a key residue, Phe-36, on the lid structure that covers the active site, resulting in an ∼5- to 20-fold difference in binding (KD). Although the magnitude of discrimination is similar to that found in designed synthetic ligand-protein complexes where dipolar interactions control fluorine recognition, these studies show that hydrophobic and solvation effects serve as the major determinant of naturally evolved fluorine selectivity.",

    "abstract": "Fluorine is an element with unusual properties that has found significant utility in the design of synthetic small molecules, ranging from therapeutics to materials. In contrast, only a few fluorinated compounds made by living organisms have been found to date, most of which derive from the fluoroacetate/fluorothreonine biosynthetic pathway first discovered in Streptomyces cattleya While fluoroacetate has long been known to act as an inhibitor of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the fate of the amino acid fluorothreonine is still not well understood. Here, we show that fluorothreonine can be misincorporated into protein in place of the proteinogenic amino acid threonine. We have identified two conserved proteins from the organofluorine biosynthetic locus, FthB and FthC, that are involved in managing fluorothreonine toxicity. Using a combination of biochemical, genetic, physiological, and proteomic studies, we show that FthB is a trans-acting transfer RNA (tRNA) editing protein, which hydrolyzes fluorothreonyl-tRNA 670-fold more efficiently than threonyl-RNA, and assign a role to FthC in fluorothreonine transport. While trans-acting tRNA editing proteins have been found to counteract the misacylation of tRNA with commonly occurring near-cognate amino acids, their role has yet to be described in the context of secondary metabolism. In this regard, the recruitment of tRNA editing proteins to biosynthetic clusters may have enabled the evolution of pathways to produce specialized amino acids, thereby increasing the diversity of natural product structure while also attenuating the risk of mistranslation that would ensue.Published under the PNAS license.",

Other CYP102 subfamily members share substrate specificity of CYP102As, but, occasionally, unusual characteristics of its own subfamily have been found. In this study, only one self-sufficient cytochrome P450 from Streptomyces cattleya was renamed from CYP102A_scat to CYP102G4, purified and characterized. UV-Vis spectrometry pattern, FAD/FMN analysis, and protein sequence comparison among CYP102s have shown that CYP102 from Streptomyces cattleya belongs to CYP102G subfamily. It showed hydroxylation activity toward fatty acids generating ω-1, ω-2, and ω-3-hydroxyfatty acids, which is similar to the general substrate specificity of CYP102 family. Unexpectedly, however, expression of CYP102G4 showed indigo production in LB medium batch flask culture, and high catalytic activity (kcat/Km) for indole was measured as 6.14±0.10min-1mM-1. Besides indole, CYP102G4 was able to hydroxylate aromatic compounds such as flavone, benzophenone, and chloroindoles. Homology model has shown such ability to accept aromatic compounds is due to its bigger active site cavity. Unlike other CYP102s, CYP102G4 did not have biased cofactor dependency, which was possibly determined by difference in NAD(P)H binding residues (Ala984, Val990, and Tyr1064) compared to CYP102A1 (Arg966, Lys972 and Trp1046). Overall, a self-sufficient CYP within CYP102G subfamily was characterized using purified enzymes, which appears to possess unique properties such as an only prokaryotic CYP naturally producing indigo.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

    "abstract": "SPATULA (SPT) and ALCATRAZ (ALC) are recent paralogs that belong to the large bHLH transcription factor family. Orthologs of these genes have been found in all core eudicots, whereas pre-duplication genes, named paleoSPATULA/ALCATRAZ, have been found in basal eudicots, monocots, basal angiosperms and gymnosperms. Nevertheless, functional studies have only been performed in Arabidopsis thaliana, where SPT and ALC are partially redundant in carpel and valve margin development and ALC has a unique role in the dehiscence zone. Further analyses of pre-duplication genes are necessary to assess the functional evolution of this gene lineage.We isolated additional paleoSPT/ALC genes from Aristolochia fimbriata, Bocconia frutescens, Cattleya trianae and Hypoxis decumbens from our transcriptome libraries and performed phylogenetic analyses. We identified the previously described bHLH domain in all analyzed sequences and also new conserved motifs using the MEME suite. Finally, we analyzed the expression of three paleoSPT/ALC genes (BofrSPT1/2/3) from Bocconia frutescens, a basal eudicot in the Papaveraceae. To determine the developmental stages at which these genes were expressed, pre- and post-anthesis carpels and fruits of B. frutescens were collected, sectioned, stained, and examined using light microscopy. Using in situ hybridization we detected that BofrSPT1/2/3 genes are expressed in floral buds, early sepal initiation, stamens and carpel primordia and later during fruit development in the dehiscence zone of the opercular fruit.Our expression results, in comparison with those available for core eudicots, suggest conserved roles of members of the SPT/ALC gene lineage across eudicots in the specification of carpel margins and the dehiscence zone of the mature fruits. Although there is some redundancy between ALC and SPT, these gene clades seem to have undergone some degree of sub-functionalization in the core eudicots, likely by changes in cis regulatory regions and to some extent in coding sequences, at least in Brassicaceae. Our results also indicate that in Bocconia frutescens, paleoSPT/ALC genes may play a role in early floral organ specification that was subsequently lost in core eudicot lineages.",

    "title": "Evolution and Expression Patterns of TCP Genes in Asparagales.",
    "abstract": "CYCLOIDEA-like genes are involved in the symmetry gene network, limiting cell proliferation in the dorsal regions of bilateral flowers in core eudicots. CYC-like and closely related TCP genes (acronym for TEOSINTE BRANCHED1, CYCLOIDEA, and PROLIFERATION CELL FACTOR) have been poorly studied in Asparagales, the largest order of monocots that includes both bilateral flowers in Orchidaceae (ca. 25.000 spp) and radially symmetrical flowers in Hypoxidaceae (ca. 200 spp). With the aim of assessing TCP gene evolution in the Asparagales, we isolated TCP-like genes from publicly available databases and our own transcriptomes of Cattleya trianae (Orchidaceae) and Hypoxis decumbens (Hypoxidaceae). Our matrix contains 452 sequences representing the three major clades of TCP genes. Besides the previously identified CYC specific core eudicot duplications, our ML phylogenetic analyses recovered an early CIN-like duplication predating all angiosperms, two CIN-like Asparagales-specific duplications and a duplication prior to the diversification of Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae. In addition, we provide evidence of at least three duplications of PCF-like genes in Asparagales. While CIN-like and PCF-like genes have multiplied in Asparagales, likely enhancing the genetic network for cell proliferation, CYC-like genes remain as single, shorter copies with low expression. Homogeneous expression of CYC-like genes in the labellum as well as the lateral petals suggests little contribution to the bilateral perianth in C. trianae. CIN-like and PCF-like gene expression suggests conserved roles in cell proliferation in leaves, sepals and petals, carpels, ovules and fruits in Asparagales by comparison with previously reported functions in core eudicots and monocots. This is the first large scale analysis of TCP-like genes in Asparagales that will serve as a platform for in-depth functional studies in emerging model monocots.",

    "title": "Natural production of fluorinated compounds and biotechnological prospects of the fluorinase enzyme.",
    "abstract": "Fluorinated compounds are finding increasing uses in several applications. They are employed in almost all areas of modern society. These compounds are all produced by chemical synthesis and their abundance highly contrasts with fluorinated molecules of natural origin. To date, only some plants and a handful of actinomycetes species are known to produce a small number of fluorinated compounds that include fluoroacetate (FA), some ω-fluorinated fatty acids, nucleocidin, 4-fluorothreonine (4-FT), and the more recently identified (2R3S4S)-5-fluoro-2,3,4-trihydroxypentanoic acid. This largely differs from other naturally produced halogenated compounds, which totals more than 5000. The mechanisms underlying biological fluorination have been uncovered after discovering the first actinomycete species, Streptomyces cattleya, that is capable of producing FA and 4-FT, and a fluorinase has been identified as the enzyme responsible for the formation of the C-F bond. The discovery of this enzyme has opened new perspectives for the biotechnological production of fluorinated compounds and many advancements have been achieved in its application mainly as a biocatalyst for the synthesis of [18F]-labeled radiotracers for medical imaging. Natural fluorinated compounds may also be derived from abiogenic sources, such as volcanoes and rocks, though their concentrations and production mechanisms are not well known. This review provides an outlook of what is currently known about fluorinated compounds with natural origin. The paucity of these compounds and the biological mechanisms responsible for their production are addressed. Due to its relevance, special emphasis is given to the discovery, characterization and biotechnological potential of the unique fluorinase enzyme.",

    "abstract": "The relBE family of Type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems have been widely reported in bacteria but none in Streptomyces. With the conserved domain searches for TA pairs in the sequenced Streptomyces genomes, we identified two putative relBE loci, relBE1sca and relBE2sca, on the chromosome of Streptomyces cattleya DSM 46488. Overexpression of the S. cattleya toxin RelE2sca caused severe growth inhibition of E. coli and S. lividans, but RelE1sca had no toxic effect. The toxicity of RelE2sca could be abolished by the co-expression of its cognate RelB2sca antitoxin. Moreover, the RelBE2sca complex, or the antitoxin RelB2sca alone, specifically interacted with the relBE2sca operon and repressed its transcription. The relBE2sca operon transcription was induced under osmotic stress, along with the ClpP proteinase genes. The subsequent in vivo analysis showed that the antitoxin was degraded by ClpP. Interestingly, the E. coli antitoxin RelBeco was able to alleviate the toxicity of S. cattleya RelE2sca while the mutant RelB2sca(N61V&M68L) but not the wild type could alleviate the toxicity of E. coli RelEeco as well. The experimental demonstration of the relBEsca locus might be helpful to investigate the key roles of type II TA systems in Streptomyces physiology and environmental stress responses.",

    "abstract": "The Orchidaceae represent one of the largest and most diverse families on the planet. However, this family is constantly threatened by predators and by the advancement of urban centers over its natural habitats. The objective of this study was to use inter-simple sequence repeat markers to evaluate the genetic diversity between orchid accessions of the Laeliinae subtribe, which comprise part of the Orchidaceae study collection at the Department of Agronomic Engineering of the Federal University of Sergipe. DNA was extracted from each specimen by using an adapted 2% cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide protocol. Similarity between individuals was calculated using the Jaccard method. Clustering was carried out by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean method, with resampling and 10,000 bootstraps. Eighty-seven fragments were obtained, all of which were polymorphic, revealing high variability between accessions. The mean similarity was 35.77% between Encyclia sp individuals, and 35.90% between specimens of Cattleya tigrina. For Epidendrum secundum, a relationship between geographic and genetic distances was observed, and the accession collected in the southern part of the State of Sergipe (Serra de Itabaiana National Park) was more divergent than that of the other parts of the state. The data generated in this study will guide further research aimed at the ex situ conservation of these materials.",

    "abstract": "Mycorrhizal fungi are a critical component of the ecological niche of most plants and can potentially constrain their geographical range. Unlike other types of mycorrhizal fungi, the distributions of orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) at large spatial scales are not well understood. Here, we investigate the distribution and diversity of Ceratobasidium OMF in orchids and soils across the Australian continent.We sampled 217 Ceratobasidium isolates from 111 orchid species across southern Australia and combined these with 311 Ceratobasidium sequences from GenBank. To estimate the taxonomic diversity of Ceratobasidium associating with orchids, phylogenetic analysis of the ITS sequence locus was undertaken. Sequence data from the continent-wide Australian Microbiome Initiative were used to determine the geographical range of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in orchids, with the distribution and climatic correlates of the two most frequently detected OTUs modelled using MaxEnt.We identified 23 Ceratobasidium OTUs associating with Australian orchids, primarily from the orchid genera Pterostylis, Prasophyllum, Rhizanthella and Sarcochilus. OTUs isolated from orchids were closely related to, but distinct from, known pathogenic fungi. Data from soils and orchids revealed that ten of these OTUs occur on both east and west sides of the continent, while 13 OTUs were recorded at three locations or fewer. MaxEnt models suggested that the distributions of two widespread OTUs are correlated with temperature and soil moisture of the wettest quarter and far exceeded the distributions of their host orchid species.Ceratobasidium OMF with cross-continental distributions are common in Australian soils and frequently have geographical ranges that exceed that of their host orchid species, suggesting these fungi are not limiting the distributions of their host orchids at large spatial scales. Most OTUs were distributed within southern Australia, although several OTUs had distributions extending into central and northern parts of the continent, illustrating their tolerance of an extraordinarily wide range of environmental conditions.© The Author(s) 2021.

Despite this specialization, no fitness advantage has been detected for adult orchid plants growing on the preferred host. Therefore, we predicted that the host specialization of these orchid species is a consequence of a bias toward particular orchid mycorrhizal fungi, which are in turn biased toward particular woody plant species.To test this hypothesis, we sampled representatives of each orchid species on B. myrtifolia and other host species across sites. Rhizoctonia-like fungi were isolated from orchid roots and identified using molecular markers.Three groups of fungi were identified, and the orchid species varied in their specificity for these. All fungal groups were found on the host B. myrtifolia; yet at all sites, only one orchid species, S. hillii, associated with all three groups.Our results demonstrate that these orchid species did vary in their mycorrhizal specificity; however, the distribution of their mycorrhizal associates did not directly explain their host associations. Rather, we propose that the mycorrhizal relationship of these orchid species is complex and have suggested future avenues of research.",

    "abstract": "Epiphytes rely on their phorophyte (host substrate) for support; epiphytic orchids also rely on mycorrhizal fungi for germination. Previous studies have proposed a degree of specificity in both interactions. Epiphytic orchids therefore provide an interesting system in which to examine multispecies interactions and the evolution of specialization.We examined the potential and actual distributions of three co-occurring, related epiphytic orchid species: Sarcochilus hillii, Plectorrhiza tridentata, and Sarcochilus parviflorus on phorophytes in Australia's temperate dry rainforests.These three small epiphytic orchid species were all biased toward certain woody plant species, in particular, the tree Backhousia myrtifolia, though the extent of specificity varied. Biases toward the most common phorophyte species were not explained by increases in adult orchid fitness, nor did probability of flowering increase on B. myrtifolia. Indeed, individuals on this woody phorophyte tended to have fewer inflorescences than those on other woody phorophytes. Only S. hillii benefited from establishment on B. myrtifolia; it had more leaves on this phorophyte than on others.In many cases what appear to be simple interactions between two species may be mediated by more complex symbioses. For this system, we propose that the cause for bias in orchid distribution occurs much earlier in an orchid's life and may be due to a bias of their mycorrhizal fungi for the dominant orchid phorophytes.",

Specifically, we investigated (1) phylogenetic relationships among genera in the subtribe, (2) the congruence between previous classifications of the subtribe and the phylogenetic relationships inferred from the molecular data, and (3) evolutionary trends of taxonomically important characters of the subtribe, such as pollinia, a spurred lip, and a column foot. In all, 75 species representing 62 genera in subtribe Aeridinae were examined. Our analyses provided the following insights: (1) monophyly of subtribe Aeridinae was tentatively supported in which 14 subclades reflecting phylogenetic relationships can be recognized, (2) results are inconsistent with previous classifications of the subtribe, and (3) repeated evolution of previously emphasized characters such as pollinia number and apertures, length of spur, and column foot was confirmed. It was found that the inconsistencies are mainly caused by homoplasy of these characters. At the genus level, Phalaenopsis, Cleisostoma, and Sarcochilus are shown to be non-monophyletic.",

    "abstract": "A missense mutation from proline to leucine at position of 141 in the CmTUB8 protein causes dwarfism in melon. The dwarfing trait is of considerable agronomic importance, as it enables increased planting density and reduced management costs. In melon (Cucumis melo L.), a high-value cucurbit crop, semi-dwarf plant architecture is particularly beneficial for lowering labor requirements in greenhouse trellis cultivation. In this study, a stably inherited dwarf mutant was identified from an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population of thin-skinned inbred line ssp. agrestis '13C'. Using bulked segregant analysis sequencing in combination with MutMap and molecular marker validation, a key missense mutation in the CmTUB8 gene was identified, which completely co-segregates with the dwarf phenotype. This mutation leads to the substitution of proline with leucine at position 141 in the CmTUB8 protein. Histological analysis showed that homozygous mutant stems have significantly reduced vascular bundle size and smaller parenchyma cells. Heterozygous plants exhibited a semi-dwarf phenotype intermediate between the wild-type and homozygous mutants, indicating potential utility in breeding. These findings provide valuable genetic resources and a theoretical basis for the development of dwarf melon cultivars.© 2025.

    "abstract": "There is mounting evidence that plant responses to environmental stress are mediated by epigenetic factors, including DNA methylation. Understanding relationships between DNA methylation, plant development and individual fitness in contrasting environments is key to uncover potential impacts of epigenetic regulation on plant adaptation. Here, we used an experimental approach combining controlled alteration of epigenetic features with exposure to stress. Two provenances of Erodium cicutarium were exposed to a demethylating agent (5-azacytidine) and recurrent drought, and effects on above- and belowground phenotypic traits related to early development, phenology and fitness assessed. Application of 5-azacytidine significantly reduced DNA methylation in leaf and root tissues. This slowed plant development, delayed flowering, and reduced the number of inflorescences produced, independent of water regime. Recurrent drought reduced final above- and belowground biomass and inflorescence production, regardless of the 5-azacytidine exposure. Increased fruit and seed-set were the only adaptations to drought in E. cicutarium, together with an increased number of flowers per inflorescence in water-stressed plants previously treated with 5-azacytidine. Epigenetic effects can desynchronize plant growth, flowering and senescence in both favourable and adverse environments. Future studies should focus on understanding intraspecific variation in ability to change the plant methylome in response to stress, and transgenerational transmission of such responses.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Nanoplastic pollutants have raised concerns about their potential impacts on plant physiology. In this study, RNA interference technology (RNAi) was leveraged to verify the intracellular regulation of nanoplastic nucleic acid carriers (NNAC) on plant traits. The results revealed that positively charged polystyrene nanoplastics (PS, 20 nm) can efficiently adsorb small interfering RNA (siRNA) at a mass ratio of 1:5 (siRNA-PS) through electrostatic interactions, forming stable siRNA-PS complexes resistant to enzymatic degradation. The red fluorescence was observed in tobacco leaf cells, providing evidence that Cy3-siRNA-PS has successfully traversed the cell wall barrier and been internalized. Meanwhile, the targeted siRNA-PS effectively induces pronounced fluorescence quenching of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in tobacco leaves, decreasing by 97.6% after 24 h. Similarly, the vibrant red flowers of glory were tuned to a faded state through the manipulation of color-controlled genes, particularly the mRNA expression of chalcone isomerase (CHI) reduced by 69.4%. Nevertheless, the expression of the GFP gene in tobacco leaves has largely reverted to the baseline levels observed in the control group after 4 days, highlighting the transient and reversible nature of this nongenetic regulation. Overall, this study uncovers the role of nanoplastic carriers, enhancing our understanding of nanoplastic biosafety and providing a foundation for the phytotoxicity of new nanopollutants.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining evolutionary potential is essential for species persistence, particularly for rare and endemic taxa that are more susceptible to habitat changes. We evaluated floral integration and phenotypic selection on the floral traits of Ipomoea cavalcantei, a species endemic to the ironstone outcrops (cangas) of the Eastern Amazon and primarily pollinated by hummingbirds. Using 90 individuals from a natural population in the Floresta Nacional de Carajás, we conducted six pollination experiments to assess the mating system. We estimated individual fitness through fruit set and characterized floral phenotype by measuring ten traits under a stereomicroscope. We analyzed the mating system using a generalized linear model, assessed floral integration through matrix correlations, and evaluated phenotypic selection via simple and multiple regressions. Ipomoea cavalcantei was found to be self-incompatible, with higher fruit set in pollen-supplemented flowers. The association between matrices (modularity) was significant for both the morphological and developmental criteria, and style length exhibited five significant correlations out of the nine. Contrary to expectations for hummingbird-pollinated flowers, corolla-associated traits were not under significant selection. Only the ovary width showed a significant selection differential and gradient in the linear analyses, likely due to selective pressure from pre-dispersal seed predators. This indicates positive directional selection: individuals with flowers bearing wider ovaries than the population mean tend to have higher relative fitness. Our findings highlight the role of pollinators in shaping floral integration in I. cavalcantei and their importance in ensuring maximum seed production, thereby supporting offspring formation even under seed predation.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Nutrient enrichment has decreased the diversity and abundance of wildflower species, raising questions about whether nutrient enrichment can further decrease the diversity and abundance of pollinators that rely on wildflowers. Whether the effects of nutrient enrichment on plant-pollinator interactions differ by nutrient type remains an open question. Moreover, plant family and flower color, two core axes of pollination niches, may further mediate how wildflowers and their pollinators respond to nutrient enrichment. We tested these questions using a nutrient addition experiment replicated at three grasslands in California, a global plant diversity hotspot. We found that adding nitrogen increased the floral abundance of Asteraceae, while decreasing that of Fabaceae, Geraniaceae, Iridaceae, and Euphorbiaceae. Adding phosphorus and potassium in the absence of nitrogen produced the opposite effects. Pollinator abundance and composition varied strongly by floral family, suggesting that these differing responses to nutrient addition by floral family may alter pollinator community composition. Nitrogen addition decreased the abundance of native blue, native green, and exotic pink flowers, while increasing the abundance of native and exotic yellow and exotic purple flowers. Consequently, nitrogen addition increased pollinator abundance on purple flowers, while decreasing pollinator abundance on pink flowers. Purple and yellow Asteraceae species, which increased under nitrogen enrichment, acted as core hubs in structuring the plant-pollinator network. Synthesis: Our findings suggest that the type of nutrient, plant family, and flower color modulate how plant-pollinator interactions respond to eutrophication.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Pigeonpea is an important leguminous food crop primarily grown in tropical and subtropical regions of the world and is a rich source of high-quality protein. Biotic (weed, disease, and insect pests) and abiotic stresses have significantly reduced the production and productivity of pigeonpea. Helicoverpa armigera, also known as the pod borer, is a major pest in pigeonpea. A substantial investigation is needed to comprehend the genetic and genomic underpinnings of resistance to H. armigera. Genetic improvement by genomics-assisted breeding (GAB) is an effective approach for developing high-yielding H. armigera-resistant cultivars. Still, no genetic markers and genes linked to this key trait have been detected in pigeonpea. In this context, a set of 146 pigeonpea minicore accessions were evaluated for four H. armigera-resistant component traits, namely, pod borer resistance (PBR), days to 50% flowering (DF), days to maturity (DM), and grain yield (GY), for three consecutive seasons under field conditions.Phenotypic data of pod borer resistance and component traits, along with the whole-genome resequencing (WGRS) data for 4,99,980 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), were utilised to perform multi-locus genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis. Two models [settlement of MLM under progressively exclusive relationship (SUPER) and fixed and random model circulating probability unification (FarmCPU)] detected 14 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) for PBR and three component traits. The MTAs with significant effect were mainly identified on chromosomes CcLG02, CcLG04, CcLG05, CcLG07, and CcLG11. These MTAs were subsequently delineated with key candidate genes associated with pod borer resistance (probable carboxylesterase 15, microtubule-associated protein 5, FAR1-RELATED SEQUENCE, and omega-hydroxypalmitate O-feruloyl transferase 4), days to maturity (RING-H2 finger protein ATL7 and leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase), and grain yield (secretory carrier-associated membrane protein and glutaredoxin-C5 chloroplastic).These research findings reported significant MTAs and candidate genes associated with pod borer resistance and component traits. Further lab-based pod bioassay screening identified four minicore accessions, namely, ICP 10503, ICP 655, ICP 9691, and ICP 9655 (moderately resistant genotypes), showing the least damage rating and larval weight gain %, compared to the susceptible checks. After validating the significant MTAs, the associated SNP markers can be effectively utilised in indirect selection, which offers potential gains for such quantitative traits with low heritability and can improve insect management more sustainably. The significant MTAs, candidate genes, and resistant accessions reported in this study may be utilised for the development of pod borer-resistant pigeonpea varieties.Copyright © 2025 Moghiya, Munghate, Sharma, Mishra, Jaba, Gaurav, Gangurde, Dube, Rangari, Roychowdhury, Gangashetty, Sharma and Pandey.",

    "abstract": "Genome size in angiosperms exhibits extraordinary variation, influencing a wide array of biological and ecological characteristics. Although prior studies have established links between genome size and certain functional traits, how the interaction between two fundamental axes of angiosperm diversity-life cycle (annual vs. perennial) and monocot-dicot distinction-shapes group-specific variation in genome size and its relationship with plant functional traits remains insufficiently understood.We assembled a comprehensive dataset encompassing 2,285 angiosperm species from 186 families, measuring genome size (1C-value) and monoploid genome size (1Cx-value) to account for polyploidy, as well as key size-related traits, including plant height and the length and width of leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds. To evaluate the relationships between genome size and these functional traits while controlling for shared evolutionary history, we conducted phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) analyses.The results indicated that the interaction between life cycle and monocot-dicot distinction is a primary determinant of both 1C and 1Cx variation, with perennial monocots exhibiting the largest 1C and 1Cx values and a significant interactive effect between these two axes of diversity. Patterns of correlation between genome size metrics (1C, 1Cx) and functional traits are group-specific and sometimes reversed, reflecting divergent adaptive strategies-for example, genome size (1C) is positively correlated with plant height in annuals but negatively in perennials. Phylogenetic correction revealed that some associations, such as the negative correlation between genome size and plant height in perennials, are largely driven by shared ancestry and disappear after accounting for phylogeny, whereas others, such as the positive correlation between genome size (1C, 1Cx) and petal length, remain robust across groups, indicating a conserved adaptive relationship. The use of 1Cx confirmed that observed patterns reflect fundamental genome architecture rather than solely polyploidy effects.These findings demonstrate that the interplay between life cycle and monocot-dicot distinction fundamentally shapes genome size (1C, 1Cx)-trait relationships in angiosperms, providing new insights into the evolutionary and adaptive mechanisms underlying plant diversity.Copyright © 2025 Liu, Wen, Fu, Cao, Cui, Du, Chen and Zhao.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin E2 enzymes (E2s) are critical mediators in the ubiquitination cascade, a post-translational modification process that regulates protein stability, activity, localization, and degradation. Here, we analyzed the E2 gene family in foxtail millet (Setaria italica), integrating comparative genomics, transcriptomics, and functional studies. A total of 52 E2 genes were identified and classified into four subfamilies (UBC, UEV, SCE, and RCE) based on phylogenetic analysis across 49 species. Notably, foxtail millet exhibited significant gene expansion. Tissue-specific expression profiling revealed distinct roles of E2 genes in growth and development. Haplotype and quantitative trait loci analyses demonstrated that several E2 genes, including SiUBC39, are associated with key agronomic traits, such as plant height, flowering time, and stress tolerance. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we validated the functional role of SiUBC39, finding that its disruption led to phenotypes resembling wild species (Setaria viridis), such as early flowering and reduced plant height and grain yield. IP-MS and transcriptome analysis revealed SiUBC39's involvement in growth and development regulation, drought stress response, and immune response. SiPIP2;1 and SiEhd2 were identified as interactors of SiUBC39, explaining its roles in blast resistance and flowering time control. Furthermore, domestication analysis identified an A/G mutation in the SiUBC39 promoter TATA box, distinguishing domesticated and wild haplotypes and highlighting its role in domestication selection. This study underscores the essential roles of E2 genes in regulating crop agronomic traits and stress responses, providing valuable insights for genetic improvement in foxtail millet and other cereals.© 2025 Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "title": "Characterization and Transcriptome Analysis Reveal Abnormal Pollen Germination in Cytoplasmic Male Sterile Tomato.",
    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a plant trait wherein plants cannot develop normal male organs because of the mitochondrial genes. Although the mitochondrial gene orf137 has been identified as the CMS-causing gene in tomatoes, its function remains unclear. In this study, we characterized the sterile male phenotypes and analyzed the CMS pollen transcriptome. Microscopic and calcium imaging analyses revealed that CMS pollen exhibited abnormal germination from multiple apertures, accompanied by elevated calcium concentrations and vesicle accumulation, which are typically observed in pollen tube tips. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 440 differentially expressed genes, including four pectin methylesterase inhibitor (PMEI) genes that were highly expressed in the pollen. PME activity was significantly reduced in CMS pollen, suggesting its association with abnormal pollen germination. ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which are key mediators of mitochondrial retrograde signaling (MRS), remained unchanged in CMS pollen, and the expression of the mitochondrial stress marker AOX1a was not elevated. These findings suggest that orf137 triggers an alternative MRS pathway independent of ATP or ROS, potentially leading to PMEI upregulation and abnormal pollen germination. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of CMS-induced male sterility in tomatoes involving nuclear gene regulation through unconventional mitochondrial signaling.",

    "title": "Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Biotechnology to Enhance Cold Stress Resilience in Legumes.",
    "abstract": "Cold stress severely limits legume productivity, threatening global food security, particularly in climate-vulnerable regions. This review synthesizes advances in understanding and enhancing cold tolerance in key legumes (chickpea, soybean, lentil, and cowpea), addressing three core questions: (1) molecular/physiological foundations of cold tolerance; (2) how emerging technologies accelerate stress dissection and breeding; and (3) integration strategies and deployment challenges. Legume cold tolerance involves conserved pathways (e.g., ICE-CBF-COR, Inducer of CBF Expression, C-repeat Binding Factor, Cold-Responsive genes) and species-specific mechanisms like soybean's GmTCF1a-mediated pathway. Multi-omics have identified critical genes (e.g., CaDREB1E in chickpea, NFR5 in pea) underlying adaptive traits (membrane stabilization, osmolyte accumulation) that reduce yield losses by 30-50% in tolerant genotypes. Technologically, AI and high-throughput phenotyping achieve >95% accuracy in early cold detection (3-7 days pre-symptoms) via hyperspectral/thermal imaging; deep learning (e.g., CNN-LSTM hybrids) improves trait prediction by 23% over linear models. Genomic selection cuts breeding cycles by 30-50% (to 3-5 years) using GEBVs (Genomic estimated breeding values) from hundreds of thousands of SNPs (Single-nucleotide polymorphisms). Advanced sensors (LIG-based, LoRaWAN) enable real-time monitoring (±0.1 °C precision, <30 s response), supporting precision irrigation that saves 15-40% water while maintaining yields. Key barriers include multi-omics data standardization and cost constraints in resource-limited regions. Integrating molecular insights with AI-driven phenomics and multi-omics is revolutionizing cold-tolerance breeding, accelerating climate-resilient variety development, and offering a blueprint for sustainable agricultural adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a crucial tool for exploiting plant heterosis, though its underlying mechanisms in tobacco remain incompletely understood. In this study, Tobacco CMSK326, derived from a naturally occurring variant of Nicotiana tabacum, exhibited a range of stamen abnormalities, including stamen degeneration, stamen absence, and carpelloid, petaloid, and sepaloid traits. Histological and electron microscopy showed that CMS K326 and its maintainer differentiated at the early bud stage. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed abnormal expressions of several key genes, including WUSCHEL (WUS), GLOBOSA (GLO), SUPERMAN (SUP), and auxin-related genes such as AUX22, during bud development. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified a module highly correlated with flower development, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), auxin, and the mitochondrial retrograde regulation signal molecules CDKE1 and KIN10. The promoter regions of 19 out of the 42 hub genes in this module possess auxin cis-response elements. These results point to a correlation between auxin irregularities and stamen development in CMS K326.",

    "abstract": "Noug (Guizotia abyssinica) is an economically important oilseed crop in Ethiopia that contributes significantly to local edible oil production and is a good protein source in animal feed. Despite its agronomic importance, the molecular basis of key agronomic traits, such as self-compatibility, photoperiod sensitivity, and oil biosynthesis, remains poorly understood due to the limited availability of genomic resources. To bridge this knowledge gap, we conducted extensive transcriptome profiling of 30 phenotypically diverse noug genotypes through RNA sequencing and de novo assembly. Our analysis generated 409,309 unigenes with an N50 of 584 bp, representing an extensive transcriptomic resource currently available for this crop. A total of 2,547 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, among which 409 were particularly associated with fatty acid metabolism pathways. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses revealed significant enrichment in lipid metabolism, stress response, and floral development pathways. Notably, many transcription factor families, such as bHLH, MYB, and WRKY, were differentially expressed between early- and late-flowering genotypes and high- and low-oil varieties, suggesting their regulatory roles in these traits. Transcriptome assembly revealed 58,852 putative transcription factors distributed in 51 families. This study provides fundamental genomic resources for marker-assisted breeding to improve productivity, oil quality, and stress resistance. The identified candidate genes present new opportunities for this underutilized yet agronomically valuable crop through modern biotechnological approaches.© 2025. The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation is generally regarded as a prerequisite for evolution. In principle, epigenetic information inherited independently of DNA sequence can also enable evolution, but whether this occurs in natural populations is unknown. Here we show that single-nucleotide and epigenetic gene body DNA methylation (gbM) polymorphisms explain comparable amounts of expression variance in Arabidopsis thaliana populations. We genetically demonstrate that gbM regulates transcription, and we identify and genetically validate many associations between gbM polymorphism and the variation of complex traits: fitness under heat and drought, flowering time and accumulation of diverse minerals. Epigenome-wide association studies pinpoint trait-relevant genes with greater precision than genetic association analyses, probably due to reduced linkage disequilibrium between gbM variants. Finally, we identify numerous associations between gbM epialleles and diverse environmental conditions in native habitats, suggesting that gbM facilitates adaptation. Overall, our results indicate that epigenetic methylation variation fundamentally shapes phenotypic diversity in a natural population.© 2025. The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the impact of green-synthesized NPK nano-fertilizers (NPKNF) on the growth, productivity, and quality of the 'Picual' olive cultivar under Egyptian conditions. Foliar sprays of NPKNF at 0 (control), 2000, 3000, and 4000 mg L-1 were applied during the \"on-year\" season. Evaluations covered vegetative growth, leaf and fruit mineral content, fruit traits, yield, oil and moisture content, and various olive oil quality indicators. In the following \"off-year\" season, flowering, fruit set, yield, and alternate bearing severity were also examined. Results indicated a significant enhancement in vegetative growth, fruit traits, yield, and oil properties during the \"on-year\" season in response to increasing NPKNF concentrations. The highest concentration (4000 mg L-1) demonstrated the most pronounced improvements across all evaluated parameters compared to the untreated control. Treated trees produced larger fruits with an increased pulp-to-pit ratio and a higher oil content. Oil extracted from NPKNF-treated fruits exhibited a measurable reduction in total phenolic compounds (289.28, 298.59, and 277.11 mg/kg with 2000, 3000, and 4000 mg L-1, respectively) compared to the untreated control (350.51 mg/kg). These compounds act as natural antioxidants and contribute to the nutritional value and organoleptic properties of olive oil. Despite this reduction, all olive oil samples were classified as extra virgin, with sensory analysis indicating a moderate fruitiness level across treatments. Furthermore, an improvement in olive flowering, fruiting parameters, and yield during the \"off-year\" was observed, along with a reduction in the severity of alternate bearing in response to NPKNF treatments. One of the most significant outcomes of the study, consistent with its objective, is the significant increase in the number of new shoots per shoot during the \"on-year,\" reaching 5.09 with NPKNF 4000 compared to 1.03 in the control. This increase contributes to the next season's yield (\"off-year\") by reducing the impact of alternate bearing, as evidenced by the significant difference in severity values, with 85.40 for NPKNF 4000 and 92.66 for the control. These findings emphasize the potential role of NPKNF treatments in enhancing olive fruit quality and oil properties, while also contributing to the mitigation of alternate bearing severity.© 2025.

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks control daily and seasonal timing of physiology and development. Because of their influence on photoperiodic flowering, variants in circadian clock genes have been selected for phenology during domestication of cereal crops. To explore the potential impact of this genetic variation on circadian-regulated traits, we investigated the relationship between the circadian clock and leaf senescence in hexaploid bread wheat. We phenotyped a collection of elite wheat cultivars for circadian rhythms, senescence and grain nutrition and used genotypes of multiple circadian clock genes to assign cultivars to circadian multilocus genotypes (MLGs). We compared the circadian-regulated transcriptomes in mature and senescent leaves by RNA sequencing and used near-isogenic lines (NILs) of a deletion in EARLY FLOWERING 3-D1 (ELF3-D1), a known phenology locus, to test for a functional contribution to the timing of senescence and grain protein content (GPC). We detected variation in circadian rhythms between wheat cultivars, which was significantly associated with the timing of senescence. We revealed substantial reorganisation of the circadian-regulated transcriptome during senescence and identified a transcriptional subnetwork representing a link between the circadian oscillator and regulators of leaf senescence. NILs of an ELF3-D1 deletion confirmed a significant effect on the timing of senescence and GPC. Our results demonstrate an important role for the circadian clock in controlling the timing of senescence in wheat, which highlights potential consequences of circadian clock genes selected for phenology on other valuable crop traits.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Zucchini (Cucurbita pepo subsp. pepo) stands as an economically vital crop in China. In zucchini breeding, plant architectural patterns and fruit morphological characteristics serve as pivotal traits. In this study, we employed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from two distinct inbred lines, JinGL (subsp. ovifera) and HM-S2 (subsp. pepo), in conjunction with a high-density genetic map. Our investigation focused on ten QTLs associated with six horticulturally significant traits, including hypocotyl length (HL), plant height (PH), and four fruit-related traits: fruit length (FL), fruit diameter (FD), fruit shape index (FSI), and fruit weight (FW). The QTLs governing HL and PH were mapped to Chr03/LG10 and named qhl3.1 and qph3.1, respectively. The candidate gene Cp4.1LG10g05910/CpDw for qph3.1 was successfully identified. Additionally, three novel QTLs related to fruit size and shape were discovered. Among them, qfsi8.1/qfl8.1, demarcated by Marker238258 and Marker240069 on Chromosome 08/Linkage group 17 (Chr08/LG17), is a new major QTL regulating the fruit shape of zucchini. Through genomic insertion-deletion (InDel) and qRT-PCR analyses, we predicted genes within the qfsi8.1/qfl8.1 candidate interval, uncovering Cp4.1LG17g02030/CpIAA12 and Cp4.1LG17g02010/CpCalB as potential candidate genes. We developed molecular markers tightly linked to qph3.1 and qfl8.1 and validated them in 171 and 224 Cucurbita pepo germplasms, achieving accuracy rates of 96% and 100%, respectively. This study deepens our understanding of the genetic basis of key traits and provides valuable references for molecular breeding in Cucurbita pepo.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11032-025-01592-y.© This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2025.",

    "title": "Bee Body Size and Foraging Behavior Predict the Pollination Role of Bees in a Buzz-Pollinated Plant Community.",
    "abstract": "Buzz pollination has been studied for over a century, yet the drivers shaping plant-pollinator interactions at the community level remain poorly understood. Although previous research has identified key functional traits associated with sonication-foraging behavior and taxonomic relationships among floral visitors, the specific bee traits that promote effective pollination are still unclear. In this study, we investigated which morphological and behavioral characteristics of flower-visiting bees predict pollination success within a plant community containing multiple buzz-pollinated species. Focusing on eight co-occurring, co-flowering plant species with poricidal anthers, we measured stigma contact (as a proxy for pollination efficiency), visitation rates, flower and whole plant handling time, intertegular span (body size), and pollen extraction mode across different bee species. Our results showed that both morphological and behavioral traits can predict pollination success. Specifically, stigma contact was positively associated with larger body size, suggesting that larger bees are more likely to touch the stigma during visits. In contrast, longer flower and plant handling times were linked to a low likelihood of stigma contacts-traits more commonly observed in smaller bees. Bees that used floral sonication visited more flowers and plants per unit time and contacted stigmas approximately four times more frequently than non-sonicating bees. However, detailed aspects of sonication behavior-such as the number and duration of buzzes-were not associated with pollination efficiency. These findings suggest that while bees visiting buzz-pollinated flowers may share similar pollen extraction mechanisms, variation in physical and behavioral traits plays a crucial role in shaping pollination dynamics.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Crop growth rate is a critical physiological trait for forage and bioenergy crops like sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], influencing overall crop productivity, particularly in photoperiod-sensitive (PS) types. Crop growth rate studies focus on either a physiological approach utilizing a few genotypes to analyze biomass accumulation or a genetic approach characterizing easily scorable proxy traits in larger populations. Thus, the genetic control of crop growth rate in terms of biomass accumulation is poorly understood in PS sorghum. In this study, we monitored biomass accumulation in a diverse panel comprising 269 PS sorghum accessions in two growing seasons. We performed sequential samplings at 11 timepoints, separating leaves from stems. For the total biomass and each fraction, we applied the beta growth function to determine the maximum crop growth rate (cm), maximum biomass accumulation (wmax), and time to cm (tm). Significant genetic variability was observed for all three parameters. Our analysis identified a practical window for cm assessment through accumulated biomass at 60-70 days after planting. Genome-wide association analysis suggested distinct and independent genetic controls of leaf and stem biomass accumulation, both physically and temporally. Common genomic regions were discovered controlling wmax and cm of stem and total biomass. These results provide new insights into the genetic control of crop growth rate, highlighting promising genomic regions for functional validation. This research also offers practical applications for plant breeding programs demonstrating the feasibility of selecting superior genotypes for both early and late biomass accumulation to enhance crop productivity.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Sugar metabolism is commonly implicated as crucial in the transition between growth and cessation during winter; however, its exact role remains elusive. The evergreen iris (Iris japonica) ceases growth in winter without entering endodormancy, yet it continues to sustain sugar metabolism and transport throughout the season. Here, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying the sugar-mediated growth transition-the shift between growth and cessation-in I. japonica through integrative physiological and transcriptional analyses. We investigated the function and transcriptional regulation of FLOWERING LOCUS C-LIKE 1 (IjFLCL1) and demonstrated that IjFLCL1 promotes growth resumption. Additionally, ALPHA-AMYLASE-LIKE 3 (IjAMY3), a starch degradation gene downstream of IjFLCL1, inhibits growth in I. japonica, potentially by modulating endogenous starch granule dynamics. Moreover, sugar-induced transcription factor SUGAR SIGNALING IN BARLEY 2 (IjSUSIBA2) activates IjFLCL1 expression. Conversely, IjSUSIBA2 directly represses the well-known dormancy mediator SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE-LIKE 2 (IjSVL2), which in turn inhibits IjFLCL1 expression. IjSUSIBA2 may be induced by both exogenous and endogenous sugar signals, subsequently regulating downstream genes. Overall, our results suggest sugar molecules might serve as both signals and energy to regulate growth transition through IjFLCL1-mediated novel pathways. These insights carry valuable implications for the cultivation and breeding of perennials to withstand the challenges posed by climate change.© 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the significance of ten different pollen types-maize, Spanish broom, cattail, marshmallow, malva, sunflower, khejri, pomegranate, ice flower, and bee pollen-in influencing the development, reproduction, and population growth of E. scutalis. The aim was to enhance our understanding of the pollen spectrum acceptable to this predatory mite. Our results indicated that E. scutalis could not complete its immature development on maize, malva, marshmallow, and Spanish broom pollen. Bee and sunflower pollen resulted in the longest developmental times, while khejri, pomegranate, and cattail led to the shortest. The females fed ice flower and pomegranate pollen had the longest lifespans. The adult pre-oviposition period (APOP) was longest with bee and sunflower pollen and shortest with khejri and pomegranate pollen. The total pre-oviposition period (TPOP) was also longest on bee and sunflower pollen, with khejri resulting in the shortest TPOP. Females fed on pomegranate had the longest oviposition days, whereas those on sunflower had the shortest. The highest and lowest fecundity were on pomegranate and sunflower pollen, respectively. Ice flower, khejri, and pomegranate supported the highest gross and net reproductive rates, while bee and sunflower pollen yielded the lowest. Khejri and pomegranate resulted in the fastest growth rates and the highest intrinsic and finite rates of increase. Consequently, maize, malva, marshmallow, and Spanish broom were unsuitable to the growth and reproduction of E. scutalis; bee and sunflower pollen were the least suitable options; ice flower and cattail provided intermediate benefits; and khejri and pomegranate pollen were the most suitable.© 2025.

    "abstract": "Polyploidy is an important driver of the evolution and diversification of flowering plants. Several studies have shown that established polyploids differ from diploids in floral morphological traits and that polyploidization directly affects these traits. However, for floral scent, which is key to many plant-pollinator interactions, only a few studies have quantified differences between established cytotypes, and the direct effects of polyploidization on floral scent are not yet known. We compared the floral scent of established polyploids and diploids from a natural mixed-ploidy population of the plant Lithophragma bolanderi (Saxifragaceae), a species pollinated by two highly specialized moth pollinators of the genus Greya (Prodoxidae). We also compared the floral scent of neopolyploids synthetically generated from diploids with the floral scent of the diploid progenitors to quantify the direct effects of polyploidization on floral scent. Established tetraploids had a higher floral scent emission rate, produced more scent compounds, and emitted a relative scent composition that differed from diploids. Neotetraploids differed in the same direction from diploids as established tetraploids from diploids, but to a lesser extent. Together, our results provide novel insights into the ways in which polyploidization reshapes floral scent, thereby potentially altering interactions between plants and pollinators.© 2025.

    "title": "Elevated CO2, Warming and Drought Differentially Impact Reproductive and Vegetative Economic Traits in Two Grassland Species.",
    "abstract": "Since the Industrial Revolution, rising atmospheric CO₂, warming, and more frequent droughts have significantly impacted ecosystems. While the response of leaf functional traits to these climate change factors have been widely studied, reproductive traits remain relatively understudied, despite their key role in the diversification and distribution of flowering plants. Here, we investigated how elevated CO₂, warming, drought, and their interactions affect floral, leaf and seed traits in two model grassland species. We also examined how these factors influence trait coordination.Two common grassland species, Lotus corniculatus and Crepis capillaris, were sampled from a 10-year climate manipulation experiment. We measured resource economic traits related to organ size, construction cost, and dry matter content in both leaves and flowers, along with seed size and number. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess trait responses, and rank-abundance curves were employed to visualize changes in trait coordination across treatments.Trait responses to climate change factors varied between species. Drought emerged as the most influential factor, affecting only leaf traits in L. corniculatus, but impacting leaf, floral, and seed traits in C. capillaris. Across both species, climate change conditions increased leaf construction costs and reduced flower size. In addition, it led to larger leaves in L. corniculatus, and fewer seeds in C. capillaris. Under extreme climate change conditions, trait coordination became stronger in both species, although C. capillaris showed no coordination response specifically to drought.Our results show that floral economic traits, like leaf traits, are responsive to individual and combined effects of climate change factors. This highlights their importance in shaping plant strategies under environmental stress and emphasizes the need to better integrate floral traits into the whole-plant economic framework.© The Author(s) 2025.

    "title": "Heat drastically alters floral color and pigment composition without affecting flower conspicuousness.",
    "abstract": "Floral pigments primarily serve to attract pollinators through color display and also contribute to protection against environmental stress. Although pigment composition can be plastically altered under stress, its impact on pollinator color perception remains poorly understood. Moricandia arvensis (Brassicaceae) exhibits seasonal floral dimorphism, with lilac spring flowers and white summer flowers. This study examines how heat-driven shifts in floral pigments alter flower color and its perception by pollinators.We conducted a comparative analysis of spring and summer floral morphs in a natural population by measuring petal spectral reflectance, analyzing absorption spectra of petal extracts, and modeling floral color in the visual systems of major pollinator functional groups. Additionally, UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis was conducted under controlled conditions to characterize differences in phenolic profiles.Spring flowers exhibited strong UV reflectance and a reduction in reflectance in the green spectrum, whereas summer flowers showed no UV reflectance and high reflectance in the visible range. Anthocyanins were detected only in spring flowers, while summer flowers accumulated high levels of UV-absorbing flavonoids. Despite these differences, both floral morphs remained visually conspicuous to hymenopterans, dipterans, lepidopterans, and coleopterans. Summer flowers produced twice as many phenolic compounds and accumulated higher concentrations, with ferulic acid and kaempferol derivatives the most prominent.White summer flowers of Moricandia arvensis are not merely anthocyanin-deficient but exhibit a distinct profile of UV-absorbing phenolics that may confer heat tolerance while preserving floral conspicuousness to pollinators. These findings highlight the role of multifunctional traits in the evolution of flower color.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "title": "The associations between floral traits and pollinator groups in two Mediterranean mountainous plant communities in the Middle Atlas of Morocco.",
    "abstract": "The relationships between floral traits and pollinators have been extensively studied over the last few decades. The concept of pollination syndrome suggests that plants pollinated by the same group of pollinators tend to develop similar combinations of floral traits. However, several studies have demonstrated the low predictability of these trait combinations and found high levels of pollination generalization within plant communities. In this context, on the basis of direct field observations, our study aimed to explore the relationships between pollinator functional groups and floral traits in two Mediterranean mountainous plant communities in the Middle Atlas of Morocco.Our research included 83 plant species belonging to two plant communities and 10 insect groups. Pollination generalization (PG) levels varied significantly between the two plant communities. Among the thirteen floral traits included in the present study, PG levels were significantly associated with only flower clustering and reward type. Clustered flowers and those producing both nectar and pollen were more generalized than solitary flowers and those producing only pollen. Bumblebees frequently visit closed zygomorphic flowers with hidden anthers in a vertical orientation, whereas flies, hoverflies, and ants prefer open actinomorphic flowers with exposed anthers in a horizontal orientation. Butterflies and beeflies were strongly associated with tubular flowers with long corollas and pink colouration. In addition to being the most abundant group, bees and beetles exhibited generalist behavior, with associations with multiple floral traits in both communities.Our results, while offering partial support for the pollination syndrome hypothesis, revealed predominantly generalized patterns of pollination among the studied plant species. Notably, these patterns were not significantly explained by all the floral traits we analysed. Furthermore, we suggest that within insect groups, especially bees and beetles, species-level variation in floral trait preferences may exist, contributing to the observed generalizability. These findings highlight the need for further research to unravel the intricacies of plant–pollinator interactions and to better understand the mechanisms driving network structure and specialization.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12862-025-02403-w.",

    "title": "Fine mapping of the dominant female sterility gene and novel model of hybrid seed production in cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata).",
    "abstract": "Hybrid breeding based on male sterility requires the removal of male parents, which is time- and labor-intensive; however, the use of female sterile male parent can solve this problem. In the offspring of distant hybridization between Brassica oleracea and Brassica napus, we obtained a mutant, 5GH12-279, which not only fails to generate gynoecium (thereby causing female sterility) but also has serrated leaves that could be used as a phenotypic marker in seedling screening. Genetic analysis revealed that this trait was controlled by a single dominant gene. Further analysis revealed that Bo2g005230, an orthologous gene of LATE MERISTEM IDENTITY1 (LMI1) in Arabidopsis, was predicted as the candidate gene and was renamed BoLMI1c. Sequence analysis revealed that homoeologous exchange (HE) occurred within the BoLMI1c gene body of 5GH12-279, which resulted in the generation of a novel fusion transcript. Two pairs of primers, N5230-1F/1R and N5230-2F/2R, were designed and successfully used for the identification of different genotypes of BoLMI1c. Transcriptome analysis revealed that BoLMI1c orchestrates the expression of several related biological processes and transcription factors. Furthermore, we found that self-pollination with mason bees produced no seeds in 5GH12-279, whereas the near-isogenic line 5GH12-170 produced seeds that were normal. Therefore, a new labor-saving hybrid seed production system with no need to remove the male parents, which is especially important for mechanized harvest in the future, has been proposed. Our study provides a valuable source of dominant female sterility and suggests the potential utilization of the female sterile line in hybrid breeding for mechanized harvest.© 2025. The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Flowering time is a critical agronomic trait with a profound effect on the productivity and adaptability of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). Strategically advancing flowering time can reduce the risk of yield losses due to extreme climatic conditions and facilitate the cultivation of subsequent crops on the same land, thereby enhancing overall agricultural efficiency. In this review, we synthesize current information on flowering time regulation in rapeseed through an integrated analysis of its genetic, hormonal, and environmental dimensions, emphasizing their crosstalk and implications for yield. We consolidate multi-omics evidence from population genetics, functional genomics, and systems biology to create a haplotype-based framework that overcomes the trade-off between flowering time and yield, providing support for the precision breeding of early-maturing cultivars. The insights presented here could inform future research on flowering time regulation and guide strategies for increasing rapeseed productivity.Copyright © 2025. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

    "title": "Vernalization reveals distinct roles of FLOWERING LOCUS T homologs in floral transition of perennial Taraxacum koksaghyz.",
    "abstract": "Flowering is a key trait in most crops and may depend on cold exposure, a process known as vernalization, but the underlying regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Taraxacum koksaghyz is a rubber-producing dandelion of the family Asteraceae, which also includes other economically important crops such as chicory and lettuce. Most T. koksaghyz plants require cold exposure to induce flowering, whereas vernalization-independent plants are more suitable for breeding. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying vernalization dependency, we identified three FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) homologs (TkFT1-3) with distinct expression patterns in response to environmental cues. At ambient temperatures, TkFT1 and TkFT2 are expressed in leaves under long-day conditions, whereas only TkFT1 is weakly expressed under short-day conditions. During cold exposure, TkFT1 expression in the leaves is abolished, but intriguingly, TkFT3 expression is induced exclusively during cold - a phenomenon not previously reported in herbaceous plants. Overexpression experiments revealed that TkFT1-3 bypass the vernalization requirement in T. koksaghyz and promote early flowering in vernalization-independent T. brevicorniculatum, probably by inducing the FRUITFULL homologs TkFUL1 and TkFUL2, which we identified as downstream targets. Our findings highlight a previously unrecognized role of an FT homolog in cold-induced flowering and suggest that TkFT1 promotes vernalization-independent flowering, whereas TkFT3 expression during cold exposure is required for vernalization-dependent flowering. This study demonstrates the function and regulation of FT genes controlling flowering time in T. koksaghyz, contributing to a broader understanding of vernalization-dependent flowering and providing knowledge that can be used in the future to facilitate breeding.Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) is an important vegetable crop that is widely cultivated throughout the world. Plant height is a key agronomic trait in cabbage, influencing architecture and yield, and is mainly determined by cell division and stem expansion. Previously, we identified a natural cabbage dwarf mutant, 99-198dw, which displays compact plant architecture, shortened internodes, and small leaves with reduced cell numbers. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this trait remains unknown. In this study, we identified the causal gene Bodw1 using a map-based cloning approach. A 1-bp deletion in the eighth exon of BoDW1 resulted in the mutant phenotype. Knockdown and knockout of BoDW1 in wild-type cabbage lines via RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in abnormal phenotypes observed in 99-198dw. BoDW1, homologous to the Arabidopsis gene RUNKEL, encodes a microtubule-associated kinase-like protein localized to microtubules and is mainly expressed in proliferating young tissues. Co-IP-MS, yeast two-hybrid, and BiFC showed that BoDW1 interacts directly with BoCDC48C, a key factor in membrane fusion at the cell division plane. Transcriptome analysis further identified differentially expressed genes associated with membrane fusion and cell plate formation. Our results suggest that BoDW1 probably regulates cabbage development by participating in cell division. Together, our study provides new insights into the molecular control of plant height.Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Transitions from outcrossing to selfing often drive the evolution of floral traits in a predictable way. However, these expectations are not as straightforward for mixed-mating systems. In this study, we examine variation in pollen-collecting hairs, a floral structure involved in secondary pollen presentation within Campanulaceae. While secondary pollen presentation is hypothesized to have evolved to promote outcrossing, we evaluate the association of pollen-collecting hairs with selfing ability.We characterized pollen-collecting hair morphology and retraction phenology in 15 populations of Campanula americana with known variation in self-fertilization ability using time-series collections and automated image analysis of pollen-collecting hair length.There was two-fold variation in the length of pollen-collecting hairs across populations that was associated with a population's within-flower selfing ability. Retraction rate of pollen-collecting hairs also varied among populations and was associated with selfing ability. Populations with greater selfing ability had longer hairs that retracted quickly early in floral anthesis.We show pollen-collecting hairs, a trait thought to have evolved to promote outcrossing, is associated with within-flower selfing ability. Through developmental changes in length, pollen-collecting hairs appear to be a plastic phenotype that is both associated with autonomous selfing and with outcrossing in C. americana. This provides support for trait specialization rather than trade-offs, and for the 'best of both worlds' hypothesis of mixed mating-system evolution.© 2025 The Author(s).

Our aim was to investigate whether this trait is population-specific or general for the species. Individuals representing eight populations were cultivated under experimental conditions for two Antarctic growing seasons separated by polar winter conditions. Our experiment indicated that the species is capable of extending its life history toward perenniality regardless of population origin. Adventitious roots at the lower nodes were observed in overwintering plants from all the studied populations. We observed a similar response regardless of the source population. Plants exposed to stress from both climatic and edaphic conditions did not survive the simulated Antarctic winter. Plants grown in optimal gardening soil expressed a life history with vegetative growth during the first vegetation season and flowered and produced seeds only during their second growing season. P. annua may exhibit at least a two-year life cycle under harsh Antarctic conditions. This trait is general for the species and determines high survival potential, which may initiate an invasion breakout under climate change. Shifts in species life history traits should be considered in the management of alien species invasions occurring under harsh environments.© 2025 The Ecological Society of America.",

Physiological indicators such as electrical conductivity, malondialdehyde, proline, and chlorophyll content were measured before and after heat stress, alongside phenotypic scoring of heat injury, to characterize the differential thermotolerance among genotypes. The results indicated that significant differences (p < 0.05) in heat tolerance at the seedling stage were observed among different broccoli cultivars after heat stress treatment at 40 °C.

Pearson's correlation analysis demonstrated that the seedling heat tolerance of different broccoli cultivars was significantly negatively correlated with electrical conductivity, with a correlation coefficient of 0.542 (p < 0.05). In this study, a rapid and robust method for determining the heat resistance response of broccoli was established, providing a scientific basis and technical support for the identification of the heat resistance of new broccoli cultivars and the selection and breeding of heat-tolerant cultivars in China.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic environments are increasingly recognised for their potential to support pollinator diversity, especially through the strategic selection of ornamental plant species. This study investigated the ecological role of Salvia yangii (formerly Perovskia atriplicifolia) in supporting solitary bees, particularly species of the genus Anthidium, within urban green spaces in Milan (Italy). Field observations were conducted in both urban and rural sites to assess pollinator visitation rates, bee abundance, and plant traits relevant to nesting and foraging. S. yangii attracted a diverse assemblage of bee genera, with Anthidium spp. consistently recorded as dominant visitors. This preference is likely driven by the short corolla tube, which facilitates the access to nectar, and its dense coverage of trichomes, which may serve as essential nesting materials. The interaction was found to be stable across environments, suggesting that S. yangii provides reliable floral and structural resources. These findings highlight the potential of specific ornamental plants to contribute meaningfully to urban pollinator conservation. While the use of exotic species warrants caution, we propose that S. yangii may be suitable for inclusion in pollinator-friendly planting guidelines under controlled horticultural conditions, offering a promising model for enhancing urban biodiversity through informed plant selection.",

Morphological, physiological (gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence), biochemical (chlorophyll, anthocyanin), and chemical composition (attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)) were evaluated. EOD G 2 h enhanced photosynthetic pigments, anthocyanins, and biomass, while control plants showed higher phenolic content. EOD R:FR induced stem elongation but reduced pigment and metabolite accumulation. GC-MS revealed organ-specific metabolic specialization, with flowers displaying greater chemical diversity than leaves. EOD G favored sesquiterpene diversity in flowers, while EOD R:FR increased nitrogen-containing compounds and unsaturated fatty acids. Vibrational data supported these shifts, with spectral signatures of esters, phenolics, and lipid-related structures.

    "abstract": "Phenology-the study of seasonal biological events shaped by climate variability-has long offered critical insights into the impact of climate change on ecosystems. Traditionally, phenological research has focused on discrete and observable events such as budburst, leaf-out, flowering, and migration. Yet ecosystems are not driven by isolated events alone, but by continuous shifts in functional traits and biogeochemical processes. The event-based phenology framework often overlooks this dynamic variability in traits and processes. To completely understand the temporal change in ecosystem functioning, we propose an expanded concept-ecosystem phenology-which integrates functional traits and biochemical processes beyond visible events. By capturing the full temporal spectrum of ecosystem dynamics, the ecosystem phenology framework provides a comprehensive understanding of ecosystem responses to climate change, with significant implications for forecasting ecosystem function and informing climate policy.© 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

Different genomic prediction (GP) models have their own niches depending on the genetic architecture of traits and computational complexity. Haploid inducers have unique trait performances, relevant for doubled haploid (DH) technology in maize (Zea mays L.).We evaluated the performance of single-trait (ST) and multi-trait (MT) GP models, which include rrBLUP, BayesB, Random Forest, and xGBoost, using data from multifamily DH inducers (DHIs). We integrated multi-trait and de novo genome-wide association studies (GWAS) within the rrBLUP framework to model four target traits: days to flowering (DTF), haploid induction rate (HIR), plant height (PHT), and primary branch length (PBL). Predictive ability (PA) was assessed through five-fold cross-validation and further validated in multi-parent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) DHIs.The average PAs of different GP methods across traits were 0.51 to 0.69. ST/MT de novo GWAS rrBLUP methods increased PA of HIR. In addition, MT GP models improved PA by 12% on average across traits relative to ST GP models in MAGIC DHIs.These findings highlight the potential benefits of integrating multi-trait modeling or de novo GWAS into the rrBLUP framework. Such GP approaches in this study enhance PAs and provide empirical evidence for accelerating the genetic improvement of maize haploid inducers.Copyright © 2025 Chen, Frei and Lübberstedt.",

    "abstract": "The autogamous nature of wheat presents a significant challenge for hybrid wheat breeding, which relies on cross-pollination. To facilitate hybrid wheat production, it is essential to modify the floral morphology of wheat to promote outbreeding rather than inbreeding. While some genetic diversity for flower morphology exists within wheat, it is limited compared to the vast and largely untapped genetic variation found in its wild relatives for potentially all agronomically important traits, including flowering characteristics. The aim of this study was to identify genomic regions associated with flowering morphology traits in the wild relative Triticum timopheevii.A set of 24 wheat-T. timopheevii introgression lines were screened for seven flowering-related traits: plant height, spike length, number of spikelets per spike, anther extrusion, filament length, anther length and pollen size.A significant level of variation was observed among the population for all traits. Phenotyping highlighted the potential of T. timopheevii for enhancing filament length and pollen size for use in hybrid wheat production. Five introgression lines showed significant improvement in filament length or pollen size compared to the parental wheat lines. Through comparative analysis of introgression lines carrying different-sized segments of the same genome and linkage group, specific T. timopheevii genomic regions were identified as carriers of alleles responsible for increased filament length and smaller pollen grains. An inter-crossing strategy between two introgression lines, each carrying different-sized introgressions from Chromosome 5G of T. timopheevii with an overlapping region, was employed to generate a new introgression line with a smaller genomic segment believed to confer the desired trait. Phenotyping of plants with this smaller introgression confirmed the presence of an allele(s) responsible for producing smaller pollen grains.This study demonstrates the potential of T. timopheevii to contribute valuable genetic variation for floral traits critical to hybrid wheat breeding, paving the way for improved outcrossing efficiency and enhanced hybrid seed production.Copyright © 2025 Othmeni, Grewal, Walker, Hubbart-Edwards, Yang, Scholefield, Ashling, King and King.",

    "abstract": "The isolation and identification of native lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from plant matrix and flowers, which are potential sources of novel strains for fermented food development. Accordingly, this study aimed to determine the presence and bacterial diversity in Hibiscus sabdariffa L. calyces, and to characterize their technological properties for potential food application. Nine isolates were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, belonging to the genera Leuconostoc (JC1 and JC2), Bacillus (JC3), Limosilactobacillus (JC4), Lentilactobacillus (JC5 and JC6), Enterococcus (JC7-JC8), and Lactococcus (JC9). Cell growth kinetics, lactic acid production, and pH reduction were used to characterize the isolated bacteria. Additionally, the technological potential of the isolates was evaluated by assessing their survival under refrigeration (4°C), freezing (-20°C), and pasteurization (both fast and slow) conditions. Susceptibility/resistance to 12 antibiotics was also determined. Results showed that isolate JC3 (Bacillus velezensis) exhibited outstanding growth parameters, tolerance to pasteurization thermal conditions (63°C/30 min and 72°C/15 s) and susceptibility to the 12 tested antibiotics. These results highlight the potential of Hibiscus calyces as a valuable source of diverse native lactic acid bacteria and related strains with promising technological traits. Further studies on the functionality and safety of these bacteria are required to confirm their probiotic potential.© The Author(s) 2025.

    "title": "Integrated transcriptomic and metabolic analysis reveal the mechanism controlling cucumber-pumpkin grafting compatibility.",
    "abstract": "The most widely used rootstock of cucumber grafting is pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata). The main task of pumpkin rootstock breeding is to evaluate its compatibility with cucumber scions. One of the main factors affecting grafting compatibility is the rootstock bleeding sap, which affects the wound healing of graft junction.We evaluated the grafting affinity of 30 pumpkin rootstocks, which were F1 hybrids derived from 56 breeding lines, by grafting them with the cucumber scion FH8. Correlation analysis of grafting compatibility with phenotypic traits of rootstock seedlings, grafted plants, and biochemical characteristics of rootstock bleeding sap highlighted the positive role of soluble solids content and the negative role of the absorbance of bleeding sapsmeasured at multiple wavelengths (from 280 nm to 700 nm). Bleeding saps from three rootstocks (RS50, RS83, and RS55) with different grafting compatibility were assayed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The predominant content in bleeding saps was amino acids. Compared with self-rooted-grafting, intergeneric grafting caused changes in the pathways associated with \"abiotic stress responses\", \"ribosome\" and \"plant hormone signal transduction\" in integrated transcriptomic and metabolic analysis. When compared with the bleeding sap of RS50 (BS-RS50) with low grafting compatibility, BS-RS55 with high grafting compatibility contained much lower content of flavonoids such as nicotiflorin, lonicerin, isoquercitrin and isovitexin. A similar difference profile of these flavonoids was not observed in cucumber scions, although flavonoid pathway was also affected by grafting in scions.Pumpkin rootstocks show a big variation in grafting compatibility with cucumbers scions, which at least partially depends on the nutrients (bleeding saps) transported from rootstocks to scions. Flavonoids play a negative role in pumpkin-cucumber grafting compatibility.© 2025. The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Japanese red or white common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivars, used to make sweetened boiled beans, are called \"kintoki\" beans. Kintoki beans are planted to precede winter wheat for crop rotation in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Therefore, early maturity is an important trait for them. The aim of this study was to map the genomic region associated with days to maturity in kintoki beans by genome-wide association study (GWAS). Significant single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with days to maturity were detected on chromosome 1 (Pv01) by GWAS in 3 years, and the candidate region for early maturity was mapped to a 473-kb region. Sequencing analysis indicated that Phvul.001G221100, a phytochrome A3 gene, is likely to be responsible for early maturity in kintoki cultivars: the insertion of a cytosine in exon 1 at position 47 644 850 on Pv01 causes a frameshift that creates an early stop codon. Our findings suggest that the loss-of-function mutation of Phvul.001G221100 is derived from a leading cultivar, 'Taisho-Kintoki', and is originated from a spontaneous mutation in the oldest kintoki cultivar, 'Hon-Kintoki'. The DNA markers targeting the functional insertion of phytochrome A3 will be useful for marker-assisted selection in kintoki bean breeding.Copyright © 2025 by JAPANESE SOCIETY OF BREEDING.",

    "title": "Impact of Domestication on Floral Traits and Rewards: A Comparison Between Wild and Domesticated Squash (Cucurbita).",
    "abstract": "Plant domestication primarily targets traits of direct human interest, such as fruit and seed characteristics; however, its indirect effects on other traits, including floral morphology and rewards (nectar and pollen), remain less understood. In this study, we investigated how domestication has influenced floral traits and rewards in domesticated and wild species of the genus Cucurbita. We compared three domesticated and three wild Cucurbita species in an experimental plot. We measured floral morphological traits, nectar volume, sugar (fructose, glucose, and sucrose), and amino acid concentrations in staminate and pistillate flowers. In addition, we evaluated pollen production and size, as well as protein and lipid concentrations, and the protein: lipid ratio in staminate Cucurbita flowers. Our results show that domesticated Cucurbita species exhibit larger floral morphological traits in both pistillate and staminate flowers compared to their wild relatives. While nectar volume increased in domesticated species, sugar and amino acid concentrations remained unchanged. In contrast, domestication had no significant effect on pollen traits, including production, size, and protein and lipid content. These findings highlight that domestication differentially affects floral traits: while floral morphology is significantly altered, most of the traits of floral rewards remain largely unaffected. This conservation may arise from the recent evolutionary history of these species and their close coevolutionary relationship with Eucera bees, emphasizing pollinator nutritional needs over artificial selection. These results underscore the complex interplay between domestication, resource allocation, and plant-pollinator interactions in shaping floral traits.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "In photoperiod sensitive plants, the timing of phenological events depends primarily on day length rather than temperature, precipitation or other environmental variables. This may make these photoperiod sensitive species less able to respond to climate change as their phenologies are more tightly controlled by day length conditions, which remain constant into the future, than by changing climatic conditions. We measured germination under three light treatments (short-day, long-day and equal light and dark) to quantify species' germination photoperiod sensitivity. We developed a novel metric that provides a continuous measure of germination photoperiod sensitivity for 67 plant species across a range of locations, habitats and growth forms. Of the 67 species, four species had significantly more seeds germinate in the long-day treatment, three species had significantly higher germination in the short-day treatment, and four species had significantly higher germination in the intermediate-day treatment. We then used this metric to quantify the relationships between germination photoperiod sensitivity (as quantified from the laboratory tests and calculated metric) and phylogeny, seed size, growth form, latitude, leaf area index (LAI) and ecosystem type. We also quantified the relationships between flowering photoperiod sensitivity (as quantified by a literature review) and the same ecological/environmental predictor variables as were tested against germination photoperiod sensitivity. There were no significant relationships between photoperiod sensitivity in germination or flowering and species' biogeography, phylogeny or other functional traits. Our findings suggest that photoperiod sensitivity is likely to be important in a range of different locations and in different types of species.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Crop domestication typically accumulates structural and deleterious variants through genetic bottlenecks and selection hitchhiking. However, the structural and deleterious variant burden has not been investigated in the foxtail millet (Setaria italica). Integrating comparative genomics, pangenomics, population genetics, and quantitative genetics, we identified 6,713 gene gains and 2,802 losses during domestication, affecting flowering time and developmental processes. Population genetics of 333 wild and cultivated accessions revealed 25.76% and 40.40% reductions in structural and deleterious variant burdens in cultivars, potentially reflecting a dramatic loss of genetic diversity of the wild progenitor. Quantitative genetics detected genetic association of yield traits, and essential roles of deleterious and structural variants in the formation of yield traits. In general, this study highlights significant impacts of structural and deleterious variants on yield traits and provides valuable guidelines for molecular breeding of foxtail millet.© 2025 The Authors.",

This study explores Coffea stenophylla, a species native to West Africa, as a potential alternative to Arabica due to its adaptability to higher temperatures and high-quality flavor profile. Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we investigated the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity within C. stenophylla accessions from Sierra Leone, focusing on traits related to growth habit, fruit and seed morphology, and plant structural characteristics. Our findings revealed significant SNP-trait associations that underscore the genetic diversity and potential of C. stenophylla for breeding programs. Additionally, we identified potential selective sweeps and conducted functional enrichment analysis, which highlighted genes involved in inflorescence development and flowering regulation, indicating adaptive evolution to local climates. These results suggest that C. stenophylla retains valuable genetic diversity that can be harnessed for developing improved cultivars better suited to the climatic challenges.Copyright © 2025 Lahai, Aikpokpodion, Bah, Lahai, Meinhardt, Lim, Ahn, Zhang and Park.",

    "abstract": "Flowering is a critical growth stage of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.), with a strong influence on growth and grain yield. To understand factors affecting such flowering stage effects, we measure the differential effects of genotype (G), environmental stress (E), and genotype by environment interaction (G × E) on quinoa growth and yield-related traits during the flowering stage. A semi-controlled pot experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with five replications. Five quinoa genotypes (Q1, Cahuil, G18, Isluga, and Q3) were evaluated under four climate-related stress vs non-stress treatment conditions: control (E1), waterlogging (E2), salinity (E3), and drought (E4). Morphological and yield traits, including plant height, number of tillers and leaves, leaf area, soil plant analysis development (SPAD) values, fresh and dry biomass, panicle length, 1000-grain weight, and individual grain yield were measured. There were significant effects of G, E, and G × E interaction on all measured traits, indicating considerable variation in genotype adaptability to abiotic stresses. The order of stress severity was E2 > E4 > E3 > E1, with waterlogging causing the most substantial reductions across growth and yield traits. The AMMI analysis highlighted strong genotype-specific responses across environments. Our findings provide insights into how quinoa responds to environmental stresses, supporting the development of research strategies and and irrigation management for quinoa under climate change related stresses.Copyright: © 2025 Loc Nguyen et al.

    "title": "Low input fast-track (LIFT): an approach for fast introgression and stacking of (R-)genes into advanced apple selections.",
    "abstract": "Using the \"LIFT\" method can halve generation time to two years, thereby reducing the breeding cycle by 50%, and accelerate the development of disease-resistant apple cultivars for sustainable production. Good sources of resistance to pests and pathogens are often found in wild relatives or ornamental apples, which are mainly small-fruited and poor-tasting. Introgressing these resistance genes via classical breeding into new apple cultivars with good tree and fruit qualities requires a series of four to five pseudo-backcrosses, which takes at least 25 years. This study aimed to develop a low-input protocol to shorten the time between generations and thereby substantially reduce the timeline for the development of cultivars with introgressed resistance. The \"LIFT\" method combined forced growth of seedlings carrying the fire blight resistance genes from 'Evereste' or from Malus × robusta 5 in a standard greenhouse with artificial vernalization periods in a cold room. This allowed flower induction in about 20% of the seedlings as early as after the second vernalization period, i.e., about two years after sowing. The fire blight resistance, the increase in single fruit weight, and the reduction of the unadapted part of the genome derived from 'Evereste' or Malus × robusta 5 were monitored across generations. No erosion of the resistance was observed, but there was an increase in single fruit weight and a progressive reduction of the unadapted genome. Therefore, the developed protocol proved to be efficient and reliable and can be applied with or without molecular markers to introduce or combine traits from wild apple relative into advanced pre-breeding selections. These pre-breeding selections are urgently needed to develop new apple cultivars with broad disease resistance, ensuring long-term sustainable apple fruit production.© 2025. The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "Reproductive traits such as flower colour can have a profound influence on the diversification of plant species, making understanding their evolutionary ramifications one of the foremost challenges for evolutionary biologists. Lysimachia monelli is a Mediterranean endemic with two markedly divergent flower colour lineages, blue and orange, which do not coexist within the same populations. We examined the relationship between lineage divergence and environmental niche differentiation for the two lineages. Genetic relationships among individuals from 21 blue and six orange populations were assessed using seven nSSR markers. Environmental niche models were projected for the present and three past periods. Low gene flow between populations and elevated heterozygosity were pervasive across L. monelli populations. Western populations of both orange and blue lineages had higher genetic diversity than their eastern counterparts, with blue lineages displaying higher diversity than orange lineages. There was conspicuous genetic differentiation between colour lineages, and populations were aggregated into five nSSR clusters. Colour lineages occupied distinct environmental niches, with lineage-specific habitat suitability primarily influenced by variations in annual precipitation and solar radiation. Bioclimatic fluctuations in the region appear to have driven the divergence of L. monelli populations along a west-to-east gradient. The findings suggest comprehensive geographic and genetic separation of the two L. monelli colour lineages, suggesting an advanced stage of speciation.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Xanthium is represented in Europe by three species complexes: X. strumarium L., X. orientale L., and X. spinosum L. The former two complexes are similar, in both morphology and ecological requirements. Xanthium strumarium is native to the Old World, whereas X. orientale originates from America and was accidentally introduced into Europe about two centuries ago. Since then, it has colonized the whole continent, while the native congener has become increasingly rare.Over two years, we conducted competition experiments to assess the impact of the introduced X. orientale on the fitness of the native X. strumarium. Germination time, dry biomass, number of burs (pistillate flower heads) and bur biomass were measured as proxies of fitness. Xanthium strumarium was grown alone (control), together with conspecifics (intraspecific competition) or with X. orientale plants (interspecific competition). We also evaluated the allelopathic effect of X. orientale over X. strumarium, by watering Xanthium seedlings with exudate of X. orientale dry leaves.Growth and reproductive traits of X. strumarium were significantly lower in individuals growing in proximity of X. orientale compared to the control, whereas intraspecific competition has a lower but still significant effect. Xanthium orientale, although, germinates and grows faster than the Old-World congener, and under interspecific competition regime, X. strumarium produces significantly lower biomass, number of burs and bur biomass. Watering with exudates negatively influences the germination and the growth of the two species. We therefore believe that interspecific competition of the introduced congener may be one of the causes explaining the drastic decline of X. strumarium populations in Europe in the past century.© 2025.

    "abstract": "The high costs of floral maintenance modulate floral longevity. In some species with massive flowering and long floral lifespan, floral longevity increases overall display by changing petal colour, which ultimately counterbalances costs of floral maintenance. However, the colour of petals remains unchanged throughout the floral lifespan in some species with long floral longevity, and the reproductive consequences of such combined traits remain elusive. In this study, we investigated how flower age affects resource availability and reproduction in Stigmaphyllon paralias A. Juss. (Malpighiaceae), a floral oil-producing species in which petal colour does not change throughout its two-day longevity. We quantified petal colour properties (spectral purity, brightness, chromatic contrast with the background, and saturation), resource availability for pollinators, and female and male reproductive performances over the lifespan of 180 flowers exposed or isolated from pollinators. Despite petal saturation decreasing throughout the floral lifespan, the colour hexagon model predicts no perceptual colour change in flowers isolated or exposed to bee pollinators. However, pollen release and oil loss increase over the floral lifespan, while the amount of pollen on stigmas did not change. These results suggest that the maintenance of floral colour in the vision of bees may be related to increased male performance.© 2025 Wiley‐VCH GmbH. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

    "abstract": "In temperate regions, early sowing of high nutritive genotypes could support maize production sustainability by avoiding warming-related unfavorable environment conditions during flowering. Seven standard maize (SM) lines and their nine quality protein maize (QPM) counterparts were evaluated for cold tolerance during germination. Cold stress (13°/6 °C) was applied for five days, after a 48 h imbibition period under optimal temperature (25°/22 °C). Germination, physiological parameters, and some primary and secondary metabolites in the seeds were analyzed. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed in cold tolerance between SM and QPM. Cold stress significantly reduced germination energy (SM-p < 0.05, QPM-p < 0.001) and physiological traits (p < 0.001), with shoot traits being most severely affected. The potentially high impact of gallic (p < 0.001), protocatechuic (p < 0.05), and p-coumaric (p < 0.001) acids on germination under stress and negative effect of lutein + zeaxhantin and β-cryptoxhantin (p < 0.05) on root length was revealed. Among all lines, L3QPM excelled under stress, with unchanged germination energy and the lowest fold change in vigor indices (0.35 for VI1, 0.45 for VI2). Also, β + γ-tocopherol and gallic and caffeic acids were significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared to its SM original.

    "abstract": "Squamosa Promoter-Binding Protein Like (SPL) is a critical transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating plant growth and development. Mining the coconut SPL family offers valuable insights into the regulation of important agronomic traits, including the length of the juvenile phase. In this study, 25 CnSPLs were identified and were classified into eight subfamilies. Analysis of gene structure and conserved protein motifs indicated a high conservation of CnSPLs within the same subfamilies; however, variations in protein structure and gene length were observed across different subfamilies. Gene expansion analysis indicated that most gene members within subfamilies originated from duplications of the same genomic segment, and transposable element insertion contributed to the divergence of gene sequences within these subfamilies. Characterization of the miR156 target sequence in SPL transcripts revealed that subfamilies IV to VIII contained these sequences, while subfamilies I to III did not. In both coconut and 14 other plant species, some SPLs lost their miR156-binding loci due to gene structure variations. The gene expression profiles revealed significant divergence between miR156-targeted and non-targeted CnSPLs; the former exhibited low expression levels in the endosperm, while the latter showed comparable expression across all tissues. Notably, CnSPL15A demonstrated steadily increasing expression levels in leaves throughout successive leaf primordia and significantly promoted flowering when overexpressed in Arabidopsis. Transient expression assays and 5' RACE confirmed that CnSPLs are targeted by miR156. This study establishes a foundation for investigating the evolutionary characteristics of CnSPLs and provides a theoretical framework for analyzing the functions of key CnSPLs involved in the coconut flowering control pathway.",

We applied structural and functional approaches for comparative genomics to unveil the adaptation of Clavibacter to plant hosts. The structural approach consisted of phylogeny and whole-genome alignment. The phylogeny suggested that C. tessallarius, C. zhangzhiyongii, C. capcisi, C. phaseoli depicted the more divergent species. Notably, C. nebraskensis, C. insidiosus, C. sepedonicus, Clavibacter sp. A6099, C. californiensis, and C. michiganensis formed a recent monophyletic clade. A synteny degree and genome rearrangements were noted. The functional approach based on prediction-annotation of secreted proteins via Sec and Tat pathways, and the prediction of metabolite biosynthetic potential. Regarding to Sec- and Tat-secreted proteins, we focused on carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and expansins. The repertoire of secreted CAZymes exhibited variation related to taxonomy of Clavibacter. The predicted expansins harbored domain variability, related to horizontal gene transfer. A heterogeneous distribution-conservation of biosynthetic genetic clusters (BGCs) regarding Clavibacter phylogeny was observed.

    "abstract": "The plant Tabernaemontana corymbosa is the famous medicinal plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae, and was well-known for its novel and diverse natural products. Traditionally, the different parts of T. corymbosa were commonly used as folk medicine to treat postpartum recovery, ulcers, fever, and tumors. In the past few decades, the alkaloids from T. corymbosa, including bisindoles, aspidosperma, tacaman, and other types, have been reported to be responsible for its biological activity. As a comprehensive summary of T. corymbosa, a total of 170 alkaloids and more than 100 biological activity items were carefully reviewed and described. Based on the collected information, the potential targets and mechanisms of T. corymbosa alkaloids (TCA) against tumors have also been further predicted using network pharmacology. The results suggested SRC, HSP90AA1, AKT1, EGFR, Bcl2, and PIK3CA may be the key targets for the cytotoxic activity of TCA. Additionally, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) enrichment results suggested the calcium signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, MAPK signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, and the pathways in cancer were considered to be its possible pathways of action. This work provides a systematic evaluation of the structural characteristics and biological activities of isolated alkaloids, which may provide a data reference for the future separation, purification, and pharmacological activity findings of T. corymbosa.© 2025 Wiley‐VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.",

    "abstract": "The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs) has expanded in the treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC), but response rates are variable, highlighting the need for predictive biomarkers. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) has been shown to predict response to ICPI, but Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) alterations are common drivers in mUC and there is preclinical and anecdotal evidence that they may predict less favorable outcomes to ICPIs, similar to ALK and ROS1 fusions in lung cancer. We sought to explore the effect of FGFR3 alterations alone and with TMB on response to ICPI in mUC.A total of 1,416 patients with mUC who received hybrid-capture next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genomic profiling were evaluated for their response to ICPI and chemotherapy based on the presence of FGFR3 alterations and TMB. A nationwide deidentified real-world clinicogenomic database (CGDB) of NGS results linked to deidentified electronic health record-derived clinical data was used to assess treatment patterns and real-world overall survival (rwOS) and real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS).Among 819 patients with mUC who received ICPI, there were no significant differences in rwOS or rwPFS between FGFR3-altered (alt) and wild-type (wt) patients. However, among patients with TMB ≥10 mut/Mb, FGFR3-alt patients trended toward longer rwOS and rwPFS than FGFR3-wt patients. Comparing first-line ICPI versus chemotherapy and adjusting for imbalances, patients with TMB ≥10 and FGFR3-alt who received ICPI also trended toward longer rwPFS than patients who received chemotherapy although no significant difference in rwOS was observed.While FGFR3 status alone is not predictive of response to ICPI, FGFR3 combined with TMB emerged as a biomarker that may be predictive of response to ICPI in mUC. Further studies involving larger patient populations are warranted to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "An estimated 25% of patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC) do not undergo genotyping, representing a missed opportunity for therapeutic targeting.Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and matched tumor sample from patients with BTC were analyzed using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay and compared. We sought to define the molecular profile of cancer-derived cfDNA, frequency of OncoKB level 1/2 alterations, plasma:tumor genotype concordance, the prognostic impact of cfDNA, and clonal evolution after targeted therapy progression.cfDNA-based genotyping was performed on 297 blood samples from 170 patients with BTC. The most frequently altered genes were TP53 (29%), FGFR2 (16%), ARID1A (13%), CDKN2A (11%), and KRAS (11%); 25% of patients had OncoKB level 1/2 alterations and 36.2% of potentially actionable alterations were detected in plasma alone. The cfDNA:tissue concordance accuracy was high (96% IDH1, 98% BRAF, 92% KRAS mutations, 99% ERBB2 amplifications, and 96% FGFR2 fusions). Detectable tumor-derived cfDNA after resection did not predict recurrence. In treatment-naïve metastatic BTC, high variant allele fraction was associated with worse progression-free survival and overall survival. RAS alterations not detected in samples before treatment were identified at progression in 24% of patients who received BRAF-, FGFR-, or HER2-directed therapy, identifying RAS alterations as a convergent mechanism of targeted therapy resistance.Molecular profiling of cfDNA from patients with BTC identified OncoKB level 1/2 gene alterations and putative genomic resistance mechanisms to targeted therapy. Concordance analysis suggests that cfDNA-based NGS is complementary to that of tissue-based sequencing in the identification of potentially actionable alterations.",

    "abstract": "Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) and cancer-related fatigue (CRF) are reported by approximately 75% of patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer and both have been linked to inflammation. We sought to test whether an inflammation polygenic risk score (iPRS) might be associated with CRCI and/or CRF.Using data from the UK Biobank, we developed an iPRS for the INFLA-Score, a composite measure of C-reactive protein, white cell count, platelet count, and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio. The iPRS was evaluated for association with CRCI and CRF among women with nonmetastatic breast cancer enrolled in two completed multisite clinical trials: URCC08106 and URCC10055. CRCI and CRF were measured before and after standard-of-care chemotherapy using the FACT-Cog and Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), respectively. Linear regression evaluated the change in FACT-Cog and MFSI scores; logistic regression evaluated binary outcomes of any versus no worsening of scores. Analyses were adjusted for patient and treatment factors. We also performed exploratory genome-wide analyses.The cohort included 802 women who received chemotherapy (anthracycline-based = 51.8%; previous surgery = 85.0%) at a median age of 55 years (range = 22-81). The iPRS was associated with a significant decrease in MFSI-SF score (β = -3.29 [95% CI, -6.25 to -0.34]; P = .029) and lower odds of decreased MFSI-SF score (odds ratio, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.47 to 0.93]; P = .016) following chemotherapy. This negative relationship was partially explained by a positive correlation of the iPRS with prechemotherapy MFSI-SF score (β = 4.33 [95% CI, 0.23 to 8.43]; P = .038). The iPRS was not associated with a change in FACT-Cog score (β = -1.12; P = .627), but single nucleotide polymorphism rs9365961 was (β = -10.05; P = 1.46 × 10-8).If validated, the iPRS could identify patients in need of supportive care interventions to reduce CRF.",

    "abstract": "Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) comprises DNA fragments released into bodily fluids via apoptosis, necrosis, or phagocytosis. cfDNA encapsulates both fragmentomics (structural) and non-fragmentomics (sequence/epigenetic) information from source cells, thereby representing a promising biomarker. While non-fragmentomics analyses have enabled diverse diagnostic applications, they often falter in diseases with subtle or widespread genomic changes due to low cfDNA abundance and clonal hematopoiesis interference. Emerging evidence reveals that cfDNA fragmentation is shaped by nucleosome occupancy, nuclease activity, and epigenetic factors, yielding distinct patterns in fragment size, end motifs, nucleosome footprints, and topology. These fragmentomics signatures diverge markedly between healthy and diseased states, and across age group, offering opportunities to complement non-fragmentomics and enhance accuracy. This review delineates key cfDNA fragmentomics targets, elucidates fragmentation mechanisms, and explores clinical applications in the context of diseases and aging. We further survey cutting-edge technologies and computational algorithms and discuss implementation challenges alongside future prospects.",

    "abstract": "Chromium (Cr) contamination affects over 20 million hectares globally, threatening agricultural productivity and food safety. Current phytoremediation efforts face challenges due to a limited understanding of Cr-tolerance mechanisms and the unclear role of anthocyanins in metal detoxification. This study investigates Cr-tolerance responses in two Brassica rapa varieties: the tolerant chinensis (BRC) and the sensitive purpuraria (BRP), using an integrated multiomics framework. BRC showed 30% less biomass reduction than BRP under Cr stress. Genomic analysis identified gene clusters specific to BRC associated with metabolic flexibility. Transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling revealed regulatory networks driven by transcription factors that support tolerance. Mechanisms contributing to Cr-tolerance included improved root glutathione metabolism for Cr sequestration, suppressed glyoxylate pathways in the stem to reduce oxidative stress, and increased leaf cysteine and methionine metabolism to support antioxidant production. Notably, anthocyanin accumulation did not correlate with Cr-tolerance; BRP accumulated 15% more anthocyanins than BRC under stress. The findings indicate that Cr-tolerance in B. rapa relies on metabolic changes and transcriptional control of detoxification pathways, not anthocyanins. Identifying key targets in specific tissues, such as root glutathione synthase and leaf sulfur metabolism pathways, offers potential avenues for developing Cr-resistant crop varieties and enhancing agricultural sustainability in metal-contaminated soils.",

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiome plays a central role in nutrient metabolism, yet the fate of exogenous nucleic acids within this ecosystem remains poorly understood. Here, we show that multiple Bacteroidales species efficiently metabolize exogenous DNA, with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron converting it into the deaminated nucleobases uracil and xanthine. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we identify ddbABCDEF, a six-gene locus encoding secreted nucleases and an outer membrane transporter, essential for exogenous DNA metabolism in B. thetaiotaomicron. Colonization of gnotobiotic mice with ddbABCDEF mutants reveals that this pathway significantly alters nucleobase pools in a gnotobiotic mouse model. Comparative genomic analyses demonstrate that ddbABCDEF is evolutionarily related to a natural transformation system present in Bacteroidota and has diversified into four distinct subtypes, each linked to unique DNA-processing activities in closely related gut Bacteroidales strains. These findings thus expand our understanding of DNA metabolism in the gut microbiome and reveal a distinctive pathway for nucleobase production with implications for host-microbe interactions.",

    "abstract": "Isolation-by-distance patterns in genetic variation are a widespread feature of the geographic structure of genetic variation in many species, and many methods have been developed to illuminate such patterns in genetic data. However, long-range genetic similarities also exist, often as a result of rare or episodic long-range gene flow. Jointly characterizing patterns of isolation-by-distance and long-range genetic similarity in genetic data is an open data analysis challenge that, if resolved, could help produce more complete representations of the geographic structure of genetic data in any given species. Here, we present a computationally tractable method that identifies long-range genetic similarities in a background of spatially heterogeneous isolation-by-distance variation. The method uses a coalescent-based framework, and models long-range genetic similarity in terms of directional events with source fractions describing the fraction of ancestry at a location tracing back to a remote source. The method produces geographic maps annotated with inferred long-range edges, as well as maps of uncertainty in the geographic location of each source of long-range gene flow. We have implemented the method in a package called FEEMSmix (an extension to FEEMS), and validated its implementation using simulations representative of typical data applications. We also apply this method to two empirical data sets. In a data set of over 4,000 humans (Homo sapiens) across Afro-Eurasia, we recover many known signals of long-distance dispersal from recent centuries. Similarly, in a data set of over 100 gray wolves (Canis lupus) across North America, we identify several previously unknown long-range connections, some of which were attributable to recording errors in sampling locations. Therefore, beyond identifying genuine long-range dispersals, our approach also serves as a useful tool for quality control in spatial genetic studies.Copyright: © 2025 Shastry et al.

    "title": "Hexokinase 2 is an RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA translation independently of glycolysis and induces melanoma cell proliferation.",
    "abstract": "Although metabolic benefits of glycolysis have been extensively described in tumor cells, the extra-metabolic functions linked to this energetic pathway in tumor growth and cell proliferation have not been clearly established yet. Recently, some key glycolytic enzymes, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase 2, were reported to regulate mRNA translation. Translational control of gene expression is considered as a critical effector in cancer biology, representing a highly promising area of research. Here, we report that Hexokinase 2 (HK2), a glucose kinase that catalyzes the first step of glycolysis at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), is an RNA-binding protein (RBP) that regulates mRNA translation in melanoma cell lines. Polysome profiling experiments followed by RNA sequencing indicate that the translational regulation exerted by HK2 is partly independent of the metabolic status or the glycolytic pathway. We found that HK2 specifically regulates translation of the mRNA encoding SOX10, a transcription factor implicated in the regulation of tumor initiation, maintenance, and progression in melanoma. RNA-protein interaction assays, including CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation (CLIP), indicate that HK2 is an RBP whose interaction with RNA is independent of its enzymatic activity, its ability to bind glucose or its association with the OMM. HK2 directly interacts with the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the SOX10 mRNA through a stem-loop RNA secondary structure. Using RNA-protein proximity ligation assays and a fluorescence-based ribosome-bound mRNA mapping method, we found that high glucose conditions, which promote the release of HK2 from the OMM, induce an increase in HK2-SOX10 mRNA interaction and SOX10 mRNA translation in the cytoplasm. We further showed that HK2-dependent SOX10 mRNA translation is involved in melanoma cell proliferation and colony formation. Collectively, our data highlight a nonmetabolic function of HK2 acting as an RBP and translation regulator.Copyright: © 2025 Dian et al.

By analyzing blood samples of more than 1300 COVID-19 patients from Tokat, Turkey (including 100 surviving and 30 deceased inpatients), we found calculated osmolality to be an excellent prognostic biomarker for mortality and significantly associated with hospitalization, independent from gender and age. Although calculated osmolality is defined as a weighted sum of sodium, glucose, and urea, the three are not necessarily independent. Other blood test biomarkers, ferritin, creatine, and chloride are also correlated with osmolality after conditioning on age. By applying a combination of collider analysis and mediation analysis, we design a pipeline to construct a causal model among all these variables in their relationship to osmolality. We confirm that while glucose and sodium are independent contributors of osmolality, glucose and urea, urea and sodium are correlated. We also conclude that ferritin and creatine are associated with osmolality through urea, and chloride's association to osmolality is through sodium.Copyright: © 2025 Cetin et al.

    "abstract": "VPS13 is the founding member of a family of proteins that mediate lipid transfer at intracellular membrane contact sites by a bridge-like mechanism. Mammalian genomes comprise 4 VPS13 genes encoding proteins with distinct localizations and function. The gene duplication resulting in VPS13A and VPS13C is the most recent in evolution and, accordingly, these two proteins are the most similar to each other. However, they have distinct subcellular localizations and their loss of function mutations in humans are compatible with life but result in two different age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, chorea-acanthocytosis and Parkinson's disease, respectively. Thus, it remains unclear whether these two proteins have overlapping functions. Here, we show that while Vps13a KO and Vps13c KO mice are viable, embryonic development of Vps13a/Vps13c double knockout (DKO) mice is arrested at midgestation. Prior to death, DKO embryos were smaller than controls, were anemic and had a smaller liver, most likely reflecting defective embryonic erythropoiesis which at this developmental stage occurs primarily in this organ. Further analyses of erythroid precursor cells showed that their differentiation was impaired and that this defect was accompanied by activation of innate immunity as revealed by upregulation of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Additionally, the RIG-I and MDA5 components of dsRNA triggered innate immunity were found upregulated in the DKO fetal liver. Activation of innate immunity may result from loss of integrity of the membranes of intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria and autophagic lysosomes, or to impaired autophagy, due to the absence of these lipid transport proteins. The surprising and striking synthetic effect resulting for the combined loss of VPS13A and VPS13C suggests that despite of the different localization of these two proteins, the lipid fluxes that they mediate are partially redundant.Copyright: © 2025 Xu et al.

Using patient-derived nasal epithelial cells, the research characterized the transcripts produced by these variants, revealing that CFTRdele2ins182, previously considered a null allele, generates alternative mRNA isoforms, one of which potentially encodes a partially functional CFTR protein. Functional assays in both heterologous and patient-derived cell models explored the impact of CFTR modulators on these variant proteins. While some rescue of CFTR activity was observed with specific modulator combinations in certain variants, the study highlights the complexity of genotype-phenotype correlations in CF and emphasizes the importance of personalized functional characterization of rare CFTR variants to guide therapeutic strategies. The findings suggest that even variants thought to be null alleles may produce proteins with residual function, opening avenues for developing targeted therapies for a broader range of CF patients.Copyright: © 2025 Pastorino et al.

Endothelial cells (ECs) play a crucial role in HCC progression, yet their involvement at the single-cell level remains underexplored. This study aimed to identify ECs-specific markers and develop a prognostic multi-gene signature for HCC using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).Single-cell transcriptomic data from 12 HCC samples were analyzed to identify EC-associated genes. A prognostic gene signature was constructed using Lasso-Cox regression analysis based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort and subsequently validated using an independent cohort from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting were employed to experimentally validate gene expression in tissue samples.Five EC-specific genes-NDRG1, HBEGF, FKBP1A, KLRB1, and FDPS-were identified as prognostic markers. The resulting multi-gene signature effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with significant differences in overall survival. Validation in the ICGC cohort confirmed the model's predictive performance. IHC and Western blotting results further confirmed the elevated expression of these genes in HCC tissues.This study established an EC-related prognostic signature that accurately predicts HCC prognosis. The identified markers may aid early diagnosis and serve as potential therapeutic targets for HCC treatment.Copyright: © 2025 He et al.

    "abstract": "Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a rare genetic disorder that results in fragile skin and blistering and may lead to mucous membrane involvement. The disease manifests in several subtypes, among which the most serious conditions are dystrophic and junctional EB. This study intends to highlight the recurrent and novel genetic abnormalities that cause EB in the Western region of Saudi Arabia.Twelve Middle Eastern Arab families affected by Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) were recruited from dermatology clinic from King Abdullah Medical Complex in Jeddah. Detailed clinical phenotyping was conducted for each patient to document EB-associated symptoms and to accurately determine the disease subtypes. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed to identify genetic variants associated with EB, and the resulting variants were classified by the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). Additionally, multiple bioinformatics tools were employed to evaluate the pathogenicity of the detected variants. Variant segregation with disease phenotype was confirmed within the families using Sanger sequencing.We identified 11 genetic variants, including three novel variants, in the COL7A1 (NM_000094.4), COL17A1 (NM_000494.4), and LAMB3 (NM_000228.3) genes across 12 EB families. The COL7A1 variants included frameshift variants (c.5924_5927del and c.6268_6269del), nonsense variants (c.1633C > T, c.1837C > T, c.2005C > T, and c.5888G > A), missense variants (c.4448G > A and c.8245G > A), and splice-site variants (c.6751-1G > A and c.8305-1G > A). Additionally, a splice-site variant was identified in COL17A1 (NM_000494.4; c.1394G > A) and another in LAMB3 (NM_000228.3; c.1977-1G > A). Bioinformatics analysis predicted these variants to be likely pathogenic because they disrupt collagen VII, XVII, and laminin 332, proteins essential for skin stability. Frameshift and nonsense variants introduce premature stop codons, leading to truncated or degraded transcripts. Splice-site variants likely cause aberrant splicing, disrupting the reading frame and impairing protein function.WES is an effective first-line diagnostic tool for identifying EB-associated variants. This study reveals locus and allelic heterogeneity in EB cases from Saudi Arabia. The findings underscore the importance of early genetic screening for improving genetic counseling in high-consanguinity populations and emphasize the need for large-scale genetic studies in the country.Copyright: © 2025 Shehata et al.

This includes honey bees, with some individuals well connected and sociable, and others at the periphery of their colony's social network. However, the genetic and molecular bases of sociability are poorly understood. Trophallaxis-a behavior involving sharing liquid with nutritional and signaling properties-comprises a social interaction and a proxy for sociability in honey bee colonies: more sociable bees engage in more trophallaxis. Here, we identify genetic and molecular mechanisms of trophallaxis-based sociability by combining genome sequencing, brain transcriptomics, and automated behavioral tracking. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with variation in sociability. Several SNPs were localized to genes previously associated with sociability in other species, including in the context of human autism, suggesting shared molecular mechanisms of sociability. Variation in sociability also was linked to differential brain gene expression, particularly genes associated with neural signaling and development. Using comparative genomic and transcriptomic approaches, we also detected evidence for divergent mechanisms underpinning sociability across species, including those related to reward sensitivity and encounter probability. These results highlight both potential evolutionary conservation of the molecular roots of sociability and points of divergence.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

    "title": "Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Profiles of Long-Term Cognitive Decline after Delirium in Intensive Care Unit Patients.",
    "abstract": "To date, no studies have reported on the differences in genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles between delirium patients with and without long-term cognitive decline (LTCD). This study aimed to identify epigenetic markers associated with LTCD after delirium using blood samples from intensive care unit (ICU) patients.Blood DNA samples from 104 patients (86 delirium patients and 18 nondelirium patients) were analyzed using the Illumina EPIC array genome-wide platform. We investigated the differences in DNAm related to the presence or absence of LTCD among delirium patients, nondelirium patients, and the entire cohort. Enrichment analyses were conducted using gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome terminology (KEGG).Among the 20 top hits of differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites associated with LTCD in patients with delirium, CpG located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6 (cg11103845) was significantly associated after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (FDR-adjusted P = .034). Enrichment analysis revealed immune-related pathways associated with LTCD. Although not statistically significant, MHC class II-related pathways, such as \"MHC class II receptor activity\" and \"MHC class II protein complex assembly,\" were also ranked among the top hits.This genome-wide DNAm analysis focused on LTCD after delirium highlights differentiating epigenetic signals related to MHC class II and immune processes. These findings provide initial evidence that epigenetic processes may play a crucial role in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying LTCD after delirium.Copyright © 2025 International Anesthesia Research Society.",

    "abstract": "Lysogens, bacteria with one or more viruses (prophages) integrated into their genomes, are abundant in the gut of animals. Prophages often influence bacterial traits; however, the influence of prophages on the gut microbiota-host immune axis in animals remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the influence of the prophage SfPat on Shewanella fidelis 3313, a persistent member of the gut microbiome of the model marine tunicate, Ciona robusta. Establishment of a SfPat deletion mutant (ΔSfPat) reveals the influence of this prophage on bacterial physiology in vitro and during colonization of the Ciona gut. In vitro, deletion of SfPat reduces S. fidelis 3313 motility and swimming while increasing biofilm formation. To understand the in vivo impact of these prophage-induced changes in bacterial traits, we exposed metamorphic stage 4 Ciona juveniles to wildtype (WT) and ΔSfPat strains. During colonization, ΔSfPat localizes to overlapping and distinct areas of the gut compared to the WT strain. We examined the differential expression of various regulators of cyclic-di-GMP, a secondary signaling molecule that mediates biofilm formation and motility. The pdeB gene, which encodes a bacterial phosphodiesterase known to influence biofilm formation and motility by degrading cyclic-di-GMP, is upregulated in the WT strain but not in ΔSfPat when examined in vivo. Expression of the Ciona gut immune effector, VCBP-C, is enhanced during colonization by ΔSfPat compared to the WT strain; however, VCBP-C binding to the WT strain does not promote the excision of SfPat in an SOS-dependent pathway. Instead, VCBP-C binding significantly reduces the expression of a phage major capsid protein. Our findings suggest that SfPat influences host perception of this important colonizing commensal and highlights the significance of investigating tripartite dynamics between prophages, bacteria, and their animal hosts to better understand the gut microbiota-host immune axis.© 2025, Natarajan et al.",

    "abstract": "Glomerular basement membrane (GBM) ultrastructural abnormalities are common in IgAN, however, few studies have focused on clinical significance and prognostic value of GBM ultrastructural changes in IgAN patients.A retrospective longitudinal cohort with 1006 biopsy-proven primary IgAN patients was collated. GBM thickness and texture of each case were assessed under transmission electron microscope. The primary end point was end stage renal disease (ESRD). Cox proportional hazards regression model was built to determine risk factors. Immunofluorescent staining was performed on patient kidney biopsy samples to validate the correlation between mesangial proliferation and abnormal GBM thickness. Twenty SNPs independently associated with IgAN in previous genome-wide association studies were genotyped in 617 patients and whole exome sequencing was performed in 56 patients to investigate potential variants underlying GBM ultrastructural changes.Of 1006 patients, 52% were female, and the mean age was 37.3±12.3 years old. Among all patients, 80 (8%) had abnormal thickness of GBM including 29 (3%) thickening of GBM and 51 (5%) thinning of GBM. Abnormal GBM texture was found in 25 (2%) patients. During a mean follow-up time of 46.4 months, 91 (9%) patients progressed to ESRD. By Cox regression analyses, we demonstrated that thickening of GBM at biopsy increased the risk of ESRD before (HR, 3.64, 95%CI, 1.47-7.55) and after adjusted by Oxford Scoring (HR, 2.92, 95%CI, 1.12-6.48) or international risk-prediction tool in IgA nephropathy (HR, 3.51, 95%CI, 1.41-7.29). Relevance analyses showed GBM thickening was positively correlated to mesangial hyperplasia and proliferation, but not genetic variants in IgAN patients.Thickening of GBM correlated with mesangial hyperplasia and proliferation was associated with ESRD in IgAN patients, demonstrating the potential of incorporating ultrastructural changes into the pathological evaluation system of IgAN.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "A cornerstone of research to improve cancer outcomes involves studies of model systems to identify causal drivers of oncogenesis, understand mechanisms leading to metastases, and develop new therapeutics. While most cancer types are represented by large cell line panels that reflect diverse neoplastic genotypes and phenotypes found in patients, prostate cancer is notable for a very limited repertoire of models that recapitulate the pathobiology of human disease. Of these, Lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) has served as the major resource for basic and translational studies. Here, we delineated the molecular composition of LNCaP and multiple substrains through analyses of whole genome sequences, transcriptomes, chromatin structure, AR cistromes, and functional studies. Our results determined that LNCaP exhibits substantial subclonal diversity, ongoing genomic instability and phenotype plasticity. While several oncogenic features were consistently present across strains, others were unexpectedly variable such as ETV1 expression, Y chromosome loss, a reliance on WNT and glucocorticoid receptor activity, and distinct AR alterations maintaining AR pathway activation. These results document the inherent molecular heterogeneity and ongoing genomic instability that drive diverse prostate cancer phenotypes and provide a foundation for the accurate interpretation and reproduction of research findings.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial strains within the genus Pseudomonas have often been characterized for their ability to biodegrade aromatic hydrocarbon pollutants, as well as high adaptability to diverse environmental stresses, including cold stress. In this study, a newly isolated bacterium, Pseudomonas migulae strain HY-2, which can grow at 10 °C by utilizing the aromatic hydrocarbon pollutant p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA) as the sole carbon source, was employed as a model to investigate bacterial gene regulatory properties during cold stress adaptation and aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation. Complete genome sequencing and transcriptomic analysis under cold conditions revealed that strain HY-2 up-regulates at least ten types of chaperone proteins potentially involved in transcriptional, translational and post-translational regulation to maintain protein homeostasis. Transcriptomic data also suggested that cold-induced biofilm formation was enhanced by exogenous polyamines, spermidine or putrescine, which was confirmed through subsequent bioassays. It is hypothesized that exogenous polyamines, commonly supplied by surrounding organisms, enhance biofilm formation in Pseudomonas, thereby aiding in cold stress resistance. Notably, expressions of functional genes responsible for PHBA biodegradation in strain HY-2 were mostly unaffected by cold stress - only three genes, including a PHBA transporter gene, were significantly up-regulated while the neighbouring 10 genes were unaffected - resulting in minimal impact on growth efficiency at 10 °C. These findings provide new insights into the genetic properties of cold adaptation and stress resilience in Pseudomonas and reaffirm the potential of this genus for bioremediation applications in natural environments without the need for extensive anthropogenic intervention.",

This study investigated the epidemiological characteristics of antibiotic resistance and the co-transfer mechanisms of lincosamide resistance genes lsa(E) and lnu(B) in 631 clinical GBS isolates from southern China. The results showed that 98.3% of isolates carried at least one antibiotic resistance gene, with lincosamide resistance genes detected in 76.1% of isolates. The lsa(E) and lnu(B) were identified as prevalent lincosamide resistance determinants alongside erm(B), with 18.7% of isolates co-carrying lsa(E) and lnu(B), and double-positive isolates predominantly distributed in high-risk clonal complexes (CCs): CC10 (15.4%), CC17 (21.7%), CC19 (17.9%) and CC103 (35.5%). Genomic analyses revealed that lsa(E)-lnu(B) formed composite resistance modules by integrating into resistance gene clusters within integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), with insertion sequence-mediated mobilization increasing their dissemination risk. In CC10 and CC17, ICESag37 served as the primary ICE harbouring lsa(E)-lnu(B), while novel genetic contexts for lsa(E)-lnu(B) were identified in CC19, CC23 and CC103. This study highlights the high prevalence of lsa(E)-lnu(B) resistance clusters in GBS clinical isolates from southern China and their ICE-mediated dissemination mechanisms, providing critical molecular epidemiological evidence for resistance surveillance and precision therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Pumilio proteins (PUM1 and PUM2) are essential post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression found across plants, animals and yeast. They bind Pumilio response elements (PREs) on messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to modulate mRNA stability and translation. PUMs have been implicated in diverse cellular processes, including stem cell maintenance, neurogenesis and cell cycle regulation. They have also been reported to negatively regulate innate immunity genes and to participate in viral RNA sensing. Previous high-throughput interactome studies revealed that PUMs bind severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. We found that SARS-CoV-2 transcripts contain multiple conserved PREs, some of which are preferentially bound by PUM2. Surprisingly, altering PUM levels does not affect the production of progeny virions. However, depletion of PUM1 slightly increases intracellular viral RNA levels, suggesting that PUM1 either plays a mild antiviral role against SARS-CoV-2 or regulates host factors that promote viral replication. Notably, PUM1 also negatively regulates innate immunity gene expression both at steady state and during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings support a complex immunomodulatory role for PUM1, acting both as a negative regulator of innate immunity genes and a mild inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RNA accumulation. However, in cell culture, these roles appear negligible based on viral progeny output. Whether the multiple PREs found in the SARS-CoV-2 genome contribute to evasion of PUM1 activity remains an open question.",

    "abstract": "Risk-reducing early-salpingectomy (RRES) and delayed oophorectomy (DO) is a novel 2-stage alternative prevention strategy to risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) that avoids detrimental consequences of premature menopause. However, direct data on the clinical effectiveness for ovarian cancer (OC) risk reduction are lacking.To explore how to define clinical effectiveness from prospective cohort studies using the estimand framework and sample size requirements.In this comparative effectiveness research study, estimand and analysis options were considered to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of RRES with DO by extending the UK PROTECTOR cohort study, a multicenter, prospective, observational, national cohort study (N = 1250 recruited from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2024) evaluating RRES and DO for OC surgical prevention. Participants were premenopausal women 30 years or older at increased OC risk due to BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variants. Participants could choose RRES, RRSO, or no surgery at entry. Sample size requirements used initial data (eg, age and BRCA1/2 distribution) from PROTECTOR (analysis undertaken from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2025).Incidence of OC after (not at) RRES and before or at DO in women with normal histologic analysis findings at surgery. The proportion of cancers prevented was estimated as the completement of the observed (O) to expected (E; assuming no preventive effect of surgery) number of cancers detected (1 - O/E).Initial data were obtained from 889 women in PROTECTOR (overall mean [SD] age, 39 [5] years), with 255 (28.7%) choosing RRSO (mean [SD] age, 42 [4] years), 405 (45.5%) choosing RRES (mean [SD] age, 38 [4] years), and 229 (25.7%) choosing no surgery (mean [SD], 38 [5] years). The preferred estimand outcome was OC incidence after surgery (RRES or RRSO) with a \"while on intervention\" strategy to account for intercurrent events. The primary target measure was the proportion of cancers prevented for RRES vs no surgery with superiority testing. The secondary target measure was noninferiority of RRES vs RRSO. An estimated 1150 RRES participants with 8 to 10 years of follow-up would provide approximately 92% power to show that 20% or more of cancers are prevented using a 1-sample binomial test of the O:E risk (external reference) at the 5% level under a range of assumptions and at least the same power for a noninferiority margin for the proportion of cancers prevented by RRES of those prevented by RRSO. Estimands based on incidence ratios had an infeasible sample size.In this comparative effectiveness study of UK BRCA carriers, the estimand differed from other ongoing clinical effectiveness studies of RRES and DO. Advantages include direct use of expected risk at baseline (unknown at design stage), easier interpretation across cohorts than absolute risk differences, and providing a feasible recruitment target for PROTECTOR to evaluate clinical effectiveness.",

In situ hybridization (ISH) has been considered the gold standard in the investigation of EBV in neoplasms. This study aimed to detect EBV in cervical carcinoma samples using ISH targeting EBERs (EBER-ISH) and the BamHI-W region of the viral genome (BamHI-W-ISH), and compare the results of both targets. Of the 88 cases collected, 9 were EBER-ISH positive (10.2%), while 33 (37.5%) cases were positive for EBV by BamHI-W-ISH, all showing staining in the nuclei of the malignant cells. No statistically significant results were found between the presence of EBV and carcinoma type, differentiation grade or tumor staging. The kappa agreement index between the two targets was 0.092. Only 4 cases were EBER-ISH(+) and BamHI-W-ISH(-). On the other hand, 28 cases were BamHI-W-ISH(+) and EBER-ISH(-). Altogether, 37/88 (42%) cases were EBV-positive by one or both targets. Infected lymphocytes were verified in 9 (10.2%) and 34 (38.6%) cases, by EBER-ISH and BamHI-W-ISH, respectively. The slight agreement demonstrated between the targets may be due to the lack of expression of EBERs, suggesting that EBV may present a distinct latency pattern in the cervical mucosa, or that it has entered the replicative cycle in some of these tumors, in both cases, explaining the low positivity rate verified through EBER-ISH, while calling into question the latter's gold standard status in the detection of EBV in malignancies. Our findings also indicate that the chosen viral genomic target may represent a suitable candidate for EBV detection by ISH.© 2025.

This would imply that ERα expression could be a predictive biomarker for ICI response. In clinical trials, centralized immunohistochemistry (IHC) minimizes variability, but routine clinical practice faces challenges from staining artifacts and interpretation variability. Transcriptomic analyses offer a standardized, quantitative alternative. Based on this, we investigated ESR1, the gene encoding ERα, as a predictive biomarker for ICI response.We analyzed bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (RNAseq) BC cohorts. Patients were stratified by ESR1 expression.In the ER+/HER2- subtype, high ESR1 expression was associated with significantly less tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. High ESR1 expression was also associated with lower levels of key immune populations such as CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T effector memory T cells, type 1 macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells, suggesting a less inflamed tumor microenvironment (TME). High ESR1 also correlated with decreased cytolytic activity and lower pCR rates after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. Single-cell RNAseq further revealed an inverse correlation between ESR1 expression and ICI response across cancer epithelial, normal epithelial, endothelial, and myeloid cells. Additionally, the predictive performance of ESR1 surpassed PDL1 in ER+ BC.High ESR1 expression was associated with an immunosuppressive TME in ER+/HER2- BC and is a more robust predictive biomarker for ICI response in this BC subtype.© 2025.

Despite this importance, most existing methods for differential abundance analysis are designed for binary group comparisons and do not incorporate ordinal information, limiting their ability to capture trends across ordered categories.To develop and evaluate statistical methods that explicitly account for ordinal phenotype structure in microbiome data, addressing challenges such as sparsity and zero inflation, and improving the detection of meaningful microbial associations.In this study, we propose and evaluate three novel approaches specifically tailored for microbiome association analysis with ordered groups: the binary optimal test, the linear trend test, and the proportional odds model-based permutation test (POMp). These methods explicitly account for the ordinal structure of phenotypes and address the sparsity and zero-inflation commonly observed in microbiome data through permutation-based inference. We applied the proposed methods to three publicly available gut microbiome datasets, including two related to obesity and one concerning colorectal cancer.All three proposed methods successfully identified differentially abundant features (DAFs) that exhibited stronger ordinal associations compared to those identified by existing methods. In particular, POMp consistently outperformed other approaches in terms of correlation with phenotype order, demonstrating its potential to identify biologically relevant markers.The findings of this study highlight the importance of incorporating ordinal information in microbiome studies and provide robust statistical tools for advancing microbial biomarker discovery in complex disease contexts.© 2025.

    "abstract": "Chinese ginger (Boesenbergia rotunda) is a culinary and traditional medicinal plant in Southeast Asia and Indo-China regions with several medicinal benefits. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of Chinese ginger extract against diabetic nephropathy and cardiomyopathy and the associated signaling pathways. Animals were randomly assigned to groups; control rats, diabetic rats, diabetic rats treated with 100 and 400 mg/kg of the B. rotunda EtOAc fraction (BRE). Treatment was administered for 5 successive weeks via oral gavage. Thereafter, the rats were evaluated for fasting blood glucose, tumour necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, lipid peroxidation activities. Gene expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 were examined. Cardiorenal histopathological and immunohistochemical were performed to assess tissue damage. BRE administration to diabetic rats notably ameliorated changes in body weight, kidney and heart weight and fasting blood glucose level. Furthermore, in diabetic rats, BRE significantly reduced malonaldehyde, tumour necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta levels considerably with increasing activity of antioxidant enzymes in the kidney and cardiac tissues of rats treated with BRE. Diabetic rats treated with BRE showed upregulated mRNA expression levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, while Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 mRNA expression in the kidney and cardiac tissues were downregulated. In addition, BRE treatment significantly reduced the cardiorenal protein expression of Bcl2 and collagen IV in the immunohistochemical analyses. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that B. rotunda exerts cardiorenal protective effect on diabetic rats due to its antidiabetic and antioxidant and may be considered a treatment for T2DM.© 2025.

Angelman syndrome can result from various (epi)genetic mechanisms, with paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 (patUPD15) being one of the rarest and least studied due to the absence of suitable models. To address this gap, we generated three independent induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from individuals with Angelman syndrome caused by patUPD15, alongside genetically matched unaffected familial controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were reprogrammed into iPSCs using a non-integrative Sendai virus-based approach expressing the Yamanaka factors. All iPSC lines underwent rigorous quality control, confirming stem cell identity, trilineage differentiation potential, and genetic and epigenetic integrity. This newly established iPSC toolkit provides a powerful platform to investigate the molecular underpinnings of Angelman syndrome caused by patUPD15, paving the way for future translational research and therapeutic development tailored for this understudied form of the disorder.© 2025.

    "abstract": "Checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in the DNA damage response through ATM-Chk2-p53 signaling. Its function in maintaining genomic stability classifies it as a tumor suppressor. Heterozygous germline pathogenic variants in CHEK2 are associated with a moderate increase in lifetime risk of breast and prostate cancer. This study assessed the prevalence of CHEK2 variants globally, with a focus on East Asian and Korean populations, for which data have remained limited. We analyzed 125,748 exomes from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), including 9,197 East Asians, along with additional data from 5,305 individuals in the Korean Variant Archive, 3,617 in Korea4K, and 1,722 in the Korean Reference Genome Database. All CHEK2 variants were classified according to guidelines established by the American College of Medical Genetics, Genomics, and Clinical Genome Resources. The global prevalence of CHEK2 variants was 0.76%, with the highest observed in the Finnish population (2.04%) and the lowest in East Asians (0.11%). By integrating data from Korean genomic databases and gnomAD, representing a total of 12,553 Korean individuals, the overall prevalence in the Korean population was estimated at 0.13%. These findings represent the first integrated estimate of CHEK2 variant frequency in Koreans using multiple population-specific genomic datasets. The results provide a useful reference for future studies and highlight the need for region-specific genetic research to inform counseling and hereditary cancer risk management.© 2025.

The lack of communication between oncologists and occupational physicians limits the accurate assessment of cancer as an occupational disease and as a cause of disability. In 2020, the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (SEOM) and the Spanish Association of Occupational Medicine Specialists (AEEMT) launched a joint initiative to strengthen prevention, reporting, and management of occupational cancer. This consensus provides a structured framework for assessing the occupational origin of cancer, facilitating case notification and classification as occupational contingencies, and supporting informed evaluations of disability and work reintegration in patients with cancer.

    "title": "Construction of a prognostic model for hepatocellular carcinoma based on necrosis by sodium overload-related genes and identification of ANKRD13B as a new prognostic marker.",
    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a prevalent malignant tumor of the digestive tract worldwide, is characterized by poor prognosis and high mortality rates. Necrosis by sodium overload (NECSO) represents a novel form of cell death that has been implicated in various cancer types. However, its functional role in HCC pathogenesis remains poorly understood. We conducted a co-expression analysis of the NECSO-associated gene TRPM4, followed by clustering analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify NECSO-related genes. Through evaluation of 101 distinct machine learning algorithm combinations, we developed prognostic models for HCC, with the optimal model selected based on the highest mean concordance index (C-index) across training and validation cohorts. Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups according to computed risk scores. Subsequent analyses compared intergroup differences in biological functions, immune microenvironment characteristics, and therapeutic responses to immunotherapy and chemotherapy. To identify pivotal biomarkers, we employed three feature selection methodologies: LASSO, SVM-RFE, and random forest algorithms. The biological significance of the identified core gene ANKRD13B was experimentally validated through in vitro cellular experiments. Using a correlation coefficient (cor) > 0.6, we identified 78 co-expressed genes. Subsequent clustering analysis of HCC samples based on these genes revealed 1,402 NECSO-associated genes. Further WGCNA, differential expression, and prognostic analyses of these genes yielded 31 prognostically genes. Among 101 machine learning combinations, the StepCox[both] combined with GBM algorithm emerged as the optimal prognostic model, achieving the highest mean C-index across training and validation cohorts. Survival analysis confirmed significantly poorer prognosis in the high-risk group. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated good predictive performance. Functional enrichment revealed distinct intergroup biological profiles, with the high-risk group and the low-risk group showing enrichment in immune-related pathways, metabolic regulation, and cell death mechanisms. Notably, the high-risk group exhibited enhanced immune activation status and superior response rates to immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy. Correlation analyses established significant associations between model genes/risk scores and cell death genes, including ferroptosis, pyroptosis, cuproptosis, and disulfidptosis. Drug sensitivity analysis identified eight chemotherapeutic agents with heightened sensitivity in high-risk patients: BI.2536, Bleomycin, Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Epothilone B, Gemcitabine, Mitomycin C, and Paclitaxel. In vitro validation confirmed ANKRD13B promoted the proliferation, invasion and migration of HCC. We established a novel NECSO prognostic model demonstrating good predictive capacity for HCC prognosis and therapeutic responsiveness. This model helps with personalized clinical management.© 2025.

Strain W85ᵀ grew optimally at 30 °C, pH 7.0, and 4.0% (w/v) NaCl, while strain SS2-1ᵀ grew optimally at 25-30 °C, pH 7.0, and 2.0-3.0% NaCl. Both strains contained menaquinone-6 as the sole respiratory quinone and shared major fatty acids, including iso-C15:0, summed feature 9 (C16:0 10-methyl and/or iso-C17:1 ω9c), and iso-C15:1 G, with iso-C15:0 3-OH additionally present in strain W85ᵀ. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine and diphosphatidylglycerol. The complete genomes of strains W85ᵀ (3.67 Mb, 3,151 genes) and SS2-1ᵀ (5.14 Mb, 4,564 genes) had a DNA G + C content of 34.1%. Genome annotation revealed that strain SS2-1ᵀ harbored more carbohydrate-active enzymes (129 genes) than W85ᵀ (60 genes), suggesting enhanced polysaccharide-degrading capacity. Ecological distribution analysis indicated that strains W85ᵀ and SS2-1ᵀ occupy distinct ecological niches, implying potential functional specialization. Both strains shared 95.0% 16S rRNA gene similarity, 71.9% average nucleotide identity (ANI), and 18.5% digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), all below species-level thresholds. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene and whole-genome sequences confirmed that strains W85ᵀ and SS2-1ᵀ form distinct lineages within the genus Aquimarina. Furthermore, ANI and dDDH values between each strain and other type strains were also well below the species delineation thresholds. Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, genomic, and ecological characteristics, strains W85ᵀ and SS2-1ᵀ are proposed as Aquimarina rhodophyticola sp. nov.

    "abstract": "Approximately 1.5% of individuals with hemoglobin disorders carry the β-thalassemia gene variant, impacting around 40,000 newborns annually. Given the incomplete understanding of β-thalassemia pathogenesis, there is an urgent need to identify effective biomarkers to advance research, diagnosis, and treatment. This study aims to identify potential biomarkers for two key purposes: (1) diagnosing transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) and (2) detecting iron overload complications, with a focus on functional markers that reflect iron metabolism dysregulation in TDT. This study integrates transcriptomic data from the Genome Sequence Archive dataset (CRA003639) with bioinformatics analysis to identify potential biomarkers associated with β-thalassemia. Subsequently, Hbb-bs and Hbb-bt double knockout mice were used to establish a β-thalassemia model, while C57BL/6JCya mice served as the control group, to validate the identified biomarkers through animal experiments. Seventeen reliable cell subsets were identified through rigorous annotation and screening. Quantitative analysis revealed a decreased proportion of immune cells (natural killer [NK] cells, T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes) and an increased proportion of erythroid cells in the β-thalassemia group. Cell subset analysis focused on subsets that closely communicated with erythroid cells. Enrichment analysis of driver genes in these subsets revealed iron metabolism-related pathways in Erythroid_02 and Erythroid_03, and a ferroptosis-related pathway in Erythroid_05. Thalassemia model mice exhibited stronger iron ion fluorescence signals in primary hepatocytes, increased levels of total iron, Fe2+, and Fe3+ in liver tissue, and decreased serum iron (SI) levels, indicating iron metabolism disorders. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results showed differential gene expression, with BCL2L1, Hepb1, and Prdx6 downregulated and Spta1 and Snca upregulated in the TDT model group. This study comprehensively characterizes TDT at the cellular and molecular levels, offering insights into its pathogenesis and identifying potential therapeutic targets.© 2025. The Author(s).",

    "abstract": "1,2-Unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) induce severe acute and chronic hepatotoxicity. Effects include an impairment of the cell cycle. To elucidate this effect, cell cycle progression was analyzed by flow cytometry, changes in cell and nucleus size, differential gene expression and protein phosphorylation patterns of regulatory key proteins in the Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line V79 and/or the human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2, both overexpressing human CYP3A4 (V793A4/HepG23A4). Lasiocarpine, a potent PA representative, reduced the cell viability of human CYP3A4-overexpressing cell lines concentration-dependently. Microscopic observation showed a marked increase in cell and nucleus size of V793A4 cells after exposure to 10 µM lasiocarpine. In the human CYP3A4-overexpressing cell lines, cells accumulate in G2/M phase after lasiocarpine treatment. Based on these findings, the gene expression pattern of cell cycle-related genes was investigated in HepG23A4 cells showing a decrease of e. g. WEE1, and CHEK1 and an increase of PAK1 and ATM. While results on cell cycle regulation at the level of gene expression are of limited relevance, protein phosphorylation plays an important role. Therefore, we also elucidated the protein phosphorylation status of regulatory key proteins. The results clearly indicate an induction of the DNA damage response and a late G2 arrest. In conclusion, an impairment of the cell cycle was observed. It correlates with the metabolic activation of lasiocarpine and is most likely mediated by adduct formation of the reactive pyrrole esters with DNA, leading to a disruption of cellular homeostasis and genomic instability.© 2025.

    "abstract": "Identifying the impact of low-penetrance genes in ovarian cancer (OC) presents a significant challenge. Polymorphisms in xenobiotic metabolism genes (XMGs) have influenced carcinogen detoxification, cancer susceptibility, and treatment response in many cancers, yet their role in OC remains fragmentary. The present study examined the genetic variants in crucial XMGs such as CYP2D6, NQO1, GSTT1, GSTM1, and GSTP1 in 460 subjects (209 OC patients and 251 controls).PCR-RFLP (CYP2D6, NQO1, and GST-P1) and multiplex-PCR (GSTT1 and GSTM1) were used for genotyping. Logistic regression was employed to evaluate the association of genotypes with OC risk. MDR analysis was used to detect SNP-SNP interactions. Various computational tools were used to assess the impact of variants on protein function, structure, and stability.The results revealed that the intermediate metabolizers (GA) of CYP2D6*4 variant conferred a 2-fold elevated OC risk (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.35-3.01; p = 0.0023). Similarly, for NQO1*2 (P187S) variant, the mutant TT genotype showed a significant association with increased OC risk (OR 2.35; 95% CI 1.25-4.42; p = 0.023). No association of GSTT1, GSTM1, and GSTP1 variants was observed in the present study. However, combinatorial gene analysis using MDR indicated that the AG (GSTP1), TT (NQO1), and GA (CYP2D6) genotypes conferred 18.4-fold increased OC risk (OR 18.42; 95% CI 2.18-155.21; p = 0.007). In silico analyses predicted the functional impact of two missense variants (rs1800566 and rs1695) and the effect on splicing for the CYP2D6*4 splice variant.The present study highlights the association of CYP2D6, GSTP1, and NQO1 variants with elevated risk of OC in South Indian women.© 2025.

However, these powerful tools create novel regulatory challenges that existing frameworks-whether AI governance or genomic privacy protections-cannot adequately address alone. This paper examines the critical regulatory gaps emerging at this intersection, highlighting tensions between AI principles that favor broad data access and genomic governance that demands stringent privacy protections and informed consent. We analyze how GLMs challenge conventional regulatory approaches as they pertain to applications in disease risk prediction, international research collaboration, and open-source model distribution. We propose a multilayered governance framework that combines policy innovations such as regulatory sandboxes and certification frameworks with technical solutions for privacy preservation and model interpretability. By developing adaptive governance strategies that bridge AI and genomic regulation, we can enable responsible GLM innovation while safeguarding individual rights, promoting equity, and addressing emerging biosecurity concerns in this rapidly evolving field.© 2025.

    "abstract": "Genome-wide genetic correlation studies have demonstrated widespread shared genetic architecture between complex traits, yet the impact of vertical pleiotropy on these genetic correlation estimates remains unclear. To address this, we propose the Horizontal and Vertical Pleiotropy (HVP) model, designed to disentangle horizontal from vertical pleiotropy effects. This approach provides unbiased genetic correlation estimates specifically attributed to horizontal pleiotropy. Through simulations, we verify that the HVP model corrects biases introduced by vertical pleiotropy-particularly the causal influence of exposure on outcomes-across various scenarios, improving the accuracy of heritability and genetic correlation estimates. Vertical pleiotropy biases genetic variances and covariances, influencing essential estimates such as SNP-based heritability and genetic correlation in traditional methods. By addressing these biases, the HVP model enhances accuracy in parameter estimation. Real data analysis shows that horizontal pleiotropy significantly contributes to genetic correlations between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and traits such as type 2 diabetes, C-reactive protein (CRP), sleep apnoea, and cholelithiasis, whereas vertical pleiotropy is more relevant between body mass index (BMI) and MetS, and MetS and cardiovascular diseases. These findings suggest that action on modifiable factors like lowering BMI may effectively reduce MetS risk, while CRP-though not causative-serves as a useful marker in risk prediction through horizontal pleiotropic genes. These results confirm the HVP model's relevance and utility in revealing the complex genetic architecture underlying traits such as metabolic syndrome, highlighting its potential to inform precision healthcare.© 2025.

    "abstract": "Head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Inherited genes are non-modifiable risk factors for HNSCC. This study aims to determine the association between LINC-PINT polymorphism and the risk of HNSCC risk in a Chinese Han population. Genomic DNA was extracted from the whole blood samples of 524 HNSCC patients and 517 healthy controls. The associations of LINC-PINT polymorphisms and HNSCC susceptibility were evaluated through logistic regression analysis. Our study showed that rs157916, rs16873842, and rs7781295 were related to an increased susceptibility to HNSCC. Stratification analyses demonstrated that rs157916 and rs7781295 were associated with an increased risk of HNSCC in age ≤ 46 years, men, and thyroid SCC. Rs16873842 and rs7801029 showed an enhanced risk of HNSCC in men. Additionally, rs16873842 and rs7781295 may increase the risk of Nasopharyngeal SCC. Moreover, the combination of rs7801029 and rs7781295 could serve as a predictive model for HNSCC. This study suggests that LINC-PINT polymorphisms may be correlated with an increased risk of HNSCC.© 2025.

    "abstract": "Three Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, cream-colored, catalase- and oxidase-positive bacterial strains, designated 2205SS24-7T, 2304DJ69-11T, and 2012CJ15-1T, were isolated from marine sponges collected in the Republic of Korea. The three novel strains grew optimally at 25-28 °C, pH 7.0, and 2-3% (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene and draft genome sequences revealed that the three novel strains clustered together with Ruegeria spongiae 2012CJ41-6T, forming a distinct clade within the genus Ruegeria. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities with R. spongiae were 97.6, 98.6, and 98.9%, respectively. Draft genome sequencing indicated genome sizes ranging from 5.2 to 6.1 Mb with DNA G+C contents between 59.0 and 60.5%. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values among the three novel strains ranged from 85.3-90.9% and 29.6-43.1%, respectively, indicating that each strain represents a separate species. Furthermore, ANI and dDDH values between the three novel strains and the type strains R. spongiae 2012CJ41-6T, R. mediterranea M17T, and R. litorea R-37T were ≤ 90.9% and ≤ 43.1%, respectively, both below the proposed thresholds for species delineation. The three novel strains possessed ubiquinone-10 as the major isoprenoid quinone and summed feature 8 (C18:1 ω7c and/or C18:1 ω6c) as the major fatty acid. The major polar lipids identified were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine. Taken together, these results support the proposal that strain 2205SS24-7T (= KACC 23237T = LMG 33064T), 2304DJ69-11T (= KACC 23805T = MCCC 1K09534T), and 2012CJ15-1T (= KACC 23842T = MCCC 1K09526T) represent three novel species within the genus Ruegeria, for which the names Ruegeria discodermiae sp. nov., Ruegeria jejuensis sp. nov., and Ruegeria hyattellae sp. nov. are proposed, respectively.© 2025.

    "abstract": "Multi-kinase and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the improvement in cancer survival remains limited due to their similar structures and targets. It is very interesting to identify novel prognosis biomarkers and corresponding ligands to improve patient survival.Herein, we propose DLCP, a deep learning (DL)-based framework, to stratify hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, identify prognostic biomarkers, and recommend potential antiHCC agents. Genomics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, and survival outcomes were integrated into a deep neural network to extract survival-related signatures, enabling stratification of patients accordingly. Prognostic biomarkers were identified by comparing molecular profiles across patient subgroups, and their ligands were screened from chemical compounds and natural products (NPs) using molecular docking and a machine learning-based predictive model. The protein-ligand interactions were validated by molecular dynamics simulations, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA).The DLCP model stratified TCGA HCC patients into two subgroups with distinct survival outcomes, validated in the LIRI-JP cohort. Molecular traits of high and low risk patients aligned well with previous HCC findings. DLCP pinpointed RAC1 that exhibited significantly elevated expression in mice with primary liver cancer and HCC patients and strong associations with cancer survival as a key biomarker. Through screening chemical small molecules, NPs, and NP derivatives from databases and literature, a germacrane-guaiane dimer derivative (KGA-1083b) emerged as a promising antiHCC agent. The complex reached equilibrium with low variations and achieved a KD value of 17.3 μM by SPR. RAC1 exhibited increased thermal stability in the presence of KGA-1083b, indicating direct binding and stabilization of the protein structure.DLCP provides a successful example of introducing DL into cancer prognosis by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics and clinical phenotype, highlights the molecular mechanism of HCC progression, and accelerates the discovery of drug candidate molecules.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) and the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test have been shown to be successful tools for predicting prostate cancer (PCa) incidence. In this study, we assessed the potential of combining PRS and PSA as biomarkers for PCa aggressiveness and subsequent mortality from patients with low to intermediate risk PCa from the TAPG-TURP cohort. Targeted sequencing of 140 PCa-related genes was performed using 162 prostate samples from PCa patients with a Gleason score of 6 or 7, 80 of whom died from the disease. An additional 305 genome samples from healthy participants of the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 were selected as controls. Two novel PRSs were developed using 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from those differentiated between alive (n = 82) and dead (n = 80) PCa patients. The first PRS was used in decision tree-based models, such as random forest (rf) able to accurately distinguish cancer from healthy samples (sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 100%, AUC = 1). The second PRS was used together with Gleason score and PSA in an artificial neural network model able to determine the aggressiveness of PCa by predicting PCa mortality with intermediate to high accuracy (sensitivity = 90%, specificity = 68.8%, AUC = 0.718). Further work must be done using our two machine learning classifiers to validate them further and apply them in the clinic, bypassing the necessity of invasive and more expensive approaches. Their application will potentially guide the clinical decision-making process and reduce costs of the clinical management of PCa patients.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "To date, no studies have reported on the differences in genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles between delirium patients with and without long-term cognitive decline (LTCD). This study aimed to identify epigenetic markers associated with LTCD after delirium using blood samples from intensive care unit (ICU) patients.Blood DNA samples from 104 patients (86 delirium patients and 18 nondelirium patients) were analyzed using the Illumina EPIC array genome-wide platform. We investigated the differences in DNAm related to the presence or absence of LTCD among delirium patients, nondelirium patients, and the entire cohort. Enrichment analyses were conducted using gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome terminology (KEGG).Among the 20 top hits of differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites associated with LTCD in patients with delirium, CpG located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6 (cg11103845) was significantly associated after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (FDR-adjusted P = .034). Enrichment analysis revealed immune-related pathways associated with LTCD. Although not statistically significant, MHC class II-related pathways, such as \"MHC class II receptor activity\" and \"MHC class II protein complex assembly,\" were also ranked among the top hits.This genome-wide DNAm analysis focused on LTCD after delirium highlights differentiating epigenetic signals related to MHC class II and immune processes. These findings provide initial evidence that epigenetic processes may play a crucial role in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying LTCD after delirium.Copyright © 2025 International Anesthesia Research Society.",

    "abstract": "Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has emerged as an opportunistic pathogen that causes life-threatening hospital-acquired infections. This microorganism possesses a diverse array of chromosome-encoded antimicrobial resistance genes, which render it inherently multidrug-resistant (MDR). Its ability to acquire additional antimicrobial resistance via mutations and the horizontal transfer of resistome elements from neighboring microbial communities has further contributed to the development of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and even pandrug-resistant (PDR) strains. These strains are resistant to routinely used antibiotics, including the first-line drug trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as well as levofloxacin and minocycline. Recently, cefiderocol - a siderophore-conjugated cephalosporin - was developed for clinical use. This antibiotic has shown high in vitro efficacy against clinically relevant MDR gram-negative pathogens. Cefiderocol efficiently transverses the outer membrane of bacteria via iron transport systems and exhibits high stability against β-lactamases. An injectable form of cefiderocol has received Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia caused by drug-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Clinical data on the use of cefiderocol for S. maltophilia infections remain limited, however, some in vitro, in vivo, and case studies have demonstrated its efficacy and successful treatment of MDR S. maltophilia infections. Given the narrow range of therapeutic options currently available, cefiderocol presents a promising alternative for the effective management of severe S. maltophilia infections. Nevertheless, the potential for the emergence of resistance remains a significant concern, as emerging evidence suggests that S. maltophilia may acquire resistance following exposure to this antibiotic.",

    "abstract": "A cornerstone of research to improve cancer outcomes involves studies of model systems to identify causal drivers of oncogenesis, understand mechanisms leading to metastases, and develop new therapeutics. While most cancer types are represented by large cell line panels that reflect diverse neoplastic genotypes and phenotypes found in patients, prostate cancer is notable for a very limited repertoire of models that recapitulate the pathobiology of human disease. Of these, Lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) has served as the major resource for basic and translational studies. Here, we delineated the molecular composition of LNCaP and multiple substrains through analyses of whole genome sequences, transcriptomes, chromatin structure, AR cistromes, and functional studies. Our results determined that LNCaP exhibits substantial subclonal diversity, ongoing genomic instability and phenotype plasticity. While several oncogenic features were consistently present across strains, others were unexpectedly variable such as ETV1 expression, Y chromosome loss, a reliance on WNT and glucocorticoid receptor activity, and distinct AR alterations maintaining AR pathway activation. These results document the inherent molecular heterogeneity and ongoing genomic instability that drive diverse prostate cancer phenotypes and provide a foundation for the accurate interpretation and reproduction of research findings.",

    "abstract": "Angelman syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the loss of function of the maternally inherited UBE3A gene within the chr15q11-q13 region. This gene is subjected to a tissue-specific form of genomic imprinting leading to the silencing of the paternal allele in neurons. Angelman syndrome can result from various (epi)genetic mechanisms, with paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 (patUPD15) being one of the rarest and least studied due to the absence of suitable models. To address this gap, we generated three independent induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from individuals with Angelman syndrome caused by patUPD15, alongside genetically matched unaffected familial controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were reprogrammed into iPSCs using a non-integrative Sendai virus-based approach expressing the Yamanaka factors. All iPSC lines underwent rigorous quality control, confirming stem cell identity, trilineage differentiation potential, and genetic and epigenetic integrity. This newly established iPSC toolkit provides a powerful platform to investigate the molecular underpinnings of Angelman syndrome caused by patUPD15, paving the way for future translational research and therapeutic development tailored for this understudied form of the disorder.© 2025.

    "abstract": "Senegal has witnessed the emergence and spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), which often cause deadly infections. Accordingly, this study aimed to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility and prevalence of carbapenemases, as well as to perform a whole-genome sequence analysis of clinical CRE isolates from a university hospital in Dakar, Senegal. MALDI-TOF MS and VITEK2 systems were used for bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). Carbapenemase- and cephalosporinase-encoding genes were screened using simplex end-point polymerase chain reaction. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The CRE isolates were resistant to almost all the 34 antimicrobials tested. Nevertheless, colistin and amikacin remained active, with susceptibility rates of 96% and 71%, respectively. Only the carbapenemase genes blaOXA-48 (53.8%; 15/28) and blaNDM (35.7%; 10/28) and the cephalosporinase gene blaCMY-1 (25%; 7/28) were identified. In this context, two extensively drug-resistant Enterobacter hormaechei isolates were subjected to WGS analysis. These isolates were assigned as sequence type (ST) 182 and carried several genes related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), metal tolerance, and virulence. An IncL/M plasmid with 61,054 bp in length was identified as carrying the blaOXA-48 gene, whereas an IncFIB(pECLA)/IncFII(pECLA)/IncX3 mutireplicon plasmid with 217,745 bp in length was detected as harboring the blaNDM-5 gene and other genes related to AMR and metal tolerance. Our study presents the first landscape of clinical CRE circulating in Senegal, along with additional genomic analysis of E. hormaechei ST182 strains, which could be useful for mitigating the burden associated with CRE in this country.IMPORTANCEThe investigation of global critical priority CRE isolates has become crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with AMR. This study revealed that colistin and amikacin can be considered good alternatives for treating CRE-associated infections in Dakar. In addition, the genomic approach revealed that the CRE isolates carried both a wide resistome and virulome. Moreover, the abundance of horizontal gene transfer regions in the genomes suggests the great implications of mobile genetic elements in the spread of AMR in Dakar. Furthermore, this study reported the complete sequences of chromosomes and blaOXA-48 and blaNDM-5-carrying plasmids. Our findings are of great importance because complete genome sequences are still rarely characterized in the West African region. Finally, this study highlights the importance of strengthening genomic surveillance of CRE in sub-Saharan African countries to mitigate the burden associated with these pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal distributions of intracellular elements (e.g., small molecules, proteins and organelles) dynamically altered in response to extracellular stimuli and pathogens, regulating those element movements, remodelling, and functions independently of mere changes in element abundance. To distinguish from conventional one- or two-dimensional spatialization, we define the precise three-dimensional localisation and interactions of intra- and extracellular elements at the single cell level as the \"stereologically spatiotemporal cell\" (SST-cell). For example, the three-dimensional construction of chromosomes ensures their proper formation and spatial positioning, facilitates the recruitment of regulatory factors, and underlies the mechanisms by which these factors maintain chromatin architecture. A large number of intracellular organelles and sub-organelles, along with their intercommunications, decide cellular biological types, subtype specification and type-specific functions. With the development of Stereo-Cell and Stereo-seq, the measurement of spatial SST-cell omics probably enables the detailed dissection of spatial heterogeneity among different cell subtypes and states, as well as their intercellular communications. Furthermore, the new approach of single SST-cell drug screening will be innovated for developing the new generation of clinical precision therapies.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "To improve plant tolerance to suboptimal availability of the micronutrient boron (B), it is crucial to understand the mechanisms plants have evolved to tolerate B-limited conditions. We assessed temporal physiological, ionomic and molecular responses to B deficiency across 185 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions grown in soil-substrate in an automated phenotyping system and on agar plates. Whilst profound shoot- and root-growth inhibition was observed in most accessions under B limitation, seven highly B-deficiency tolerant accessions with < 20% reduced fresh and digital biomass accumulation were identified. Boron-efficient accessions were characterised by sustaining lateral more than primary root growth under B limitation. Whilst expression of B transporters increased under B limitation, no correlations between expression and B uptake or B efficiency were observed, suggesting increased B-use efficiency in B-efficient accessions. Phylogenetic analysis suggests B efficiency evolved independently multiple times in response to local environmental needs. Genome-wide association analyses identified a QTL on chromosome 4 that is associated with both root and shoot resilience to B limitation. Our results suggest that an optimised root system contributes to maintaining shoot productivity in B-limited conditions. Further dissection of the identified QTL and candidate genes will form an important strategy for elucidating the molecular control of B efficiency.© 2025 The Author(s).

In this study, the United States Department of Agriculture-Agriculture Research Service, National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) Sudan core collection was evaluated for rust-resistant response across four tropical environments. The analysis identified 18 accessions with rust resistant, among which four accessions (PI 568621, PI 569393, PI 570548, and PI 570974) consistently showed no rust pustules across all environments. Genome-wide association analysis led to the identification of a 57 kbp genomic region on chromosome 8 that encompasses a cluster of five homologous R genes. The resequencing analysis of the first exon from one candidate gene (Sobic.008G178200) found 61 point mutations that generate seven haplotypes. The high homology of these five genes and seven haplotypes indicates that this cluster might be acting as a single locus (Rp2) against P. purpurea. Comparative genome analysis found that the orthologs of Rp2 locus in maize (Zm00001d023311) are associated with the resistant response to Puccinia polysora, the causal agent of southern corn rust and in rice (Os12G29690), with resistance to the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens). The introgression of the Rp2 locus into elite varieties or the inclusion of top-performing Sudanese tropical accessions in pre-breeding germplasm can accelerate the development of improved sorghum germplasm with durable rust resistant.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) based on MRI of medulloblastoma enables risk stratification, potentially aiding in therapeutic decisions. This study aims to develop DL models that identify four medulloblastoma molecular subgroups and prognostic-related genetic signatures.This retrospective study enrolled 325 patients for model development and an independent external validation cohort of 124 patients, totaling 449 MB patients from 2 medical institutes. Consecutive patients with newly diagnosed MB at MRI (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted) at two medical institutes between January 2015 and June 2023 were identified. Two-stage sequential DL models were designed-MB-CNN that first identifies wingless (WNT), sonic hedgehog (SHH), Group 3, and Group 4. Further, prognostic-related genetic signatures using DL models (MB-CNN_TP53/MYC/Chr11) were developed to predict TP53 mutation, MYC amplification, and chromosome 11 loss status. A hybrid model combining MB-CNN and conventional data (clinical information and MRI features) was compared to a logistic regression model constructed only with conventional data. Four-classification tasks were evaluated with confusion matrices (accuracy) and two-classification tasks with ROC curves (area under the curve (AUC)).The datasets comprised 449 patients (mean age ± SD at diagnosis, 13.55 years ± 2.33, 249 males). MB-CNN accurately classified MB subgroups in the external test dataset, achieving a median accuracy of 77.50% (range in 76.29% to 78.71%). MB-CNN_TP53/MYC/Chr11 models effectively predicted signatures (AUC of TP53 in SHH: 0.91, MYC amplification in Group 3: 0.87, chromosome 11 loss in Group 4: 0.89). The accuracy of the hybrid model outperformed the logistic regression model (82.20% vs. 59.14%, P = .009) and showed comparable performance to MB-CNN (82.20% vs. 77.50%, P = 0.105).MRI-based DL models allowed identification of the molecular medulloblastoma subgroups and prognostic-related genetic signatures.© 2025.

    "abstract": "The European hamster (Cricetus cricetus) was once a pest on European farmland, but its numbers have declined dramatically in recent decades, making it a critically endangered species throughout Europe and beyond. While it is strictly protected by EU law and several conservations, breeding and release programs have been initiated, and little is known about the level of genetic erosion and inbreeding on a European scale.Here, we present a chromosome-level de novo genome of a female hamster and a first population genomic analysis from the western range of the species' distribution, using Illumina short reads (10 × coverage) from 34 individuals. The genome is 2.89 Gbp long, with 11 chromosome-level scaffolds and around 600 unplaced scaffolds and scaffolds N50 of 267 Mbp. The genome is above the average length of a mammalian genome and longer than that of other studied hamster species. Four distinct hamster populations with no admixture can be identified, indicating highly isolated populations with limited connectivity. Heterozygosity (Ho) is generally low (< 0.05%, comparable to polar bears) with some exceptions of populations with Ho near zero and a few with Ho as high as 0.2%.Most dramatically, the genomes of individuals used as founders for conservation breeding programs show exceptionally long runs of homozygosity, questioning its long-term suitability. This study confirms earlier concerns about the dramatically decreasing genetic diversity of the European hamster and provides a basis for future conservation efforts, which require consideration of population genetic factors.© 2025.

    "title": "Beneficial reversal of dominance maintains a large-effect resistance polymorphism under fluctuating insecticide selection.",
    "abstract": "Large-effect standing genetic variation is commonly found in natural populations and must be maintained in the face of directional natural selection. Theory suggests that under fluctuating selective pressures, beneficial reversal of dominance-where alleles are dominant when beneficial and recessive when deleterious-can strongly stabilize large-effect polymorphisms. However, empirical evidence for this mechanism remains limited because testing requires measurements of selection and dominance in fitness in natural conditions. Here we investigate large-effect fitness polymorphisms at the Ace locus of Drosophila melanogaster that confer insecticide resistance and persist at intermediate frequencies worldwide. By combining laboratory and large-scale field mesocosm experiments with insecticide manipulation and mathematical modelling, we show that the benefits of the resistant Ace alleles are dominant in pesticide-rich environments, while their fitness costs are recessive in pesticide-free environments. We further show that temporally fluctuating insecticide selection generates chromosome-scale genomic perturbations at sites linked to the resistant Ace alleles. Overall, our results suggest that beneficial reversal of dominance under temporally fluctuating selection might plausibly contribute to the maintenance of functional genetic variation and, by stabilizing large frequency fluctuations, impact long-range patterns of genomic variation.© 2025.

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key driver of neurodegeneration, highlighting mitophagy as a tractable therapeutic axis. Yet the clinical translation of mitophagy-targeting agents requires robust, GLP-compliant nonclinical safety data to support and de-risk human trials in line with international guidelines. TJ0113, a first-in-class small-molecule inducer of mitophagy, has shown disease-modifying activity in preclinical models and is being evaluated in a registered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II trial in Parkinson's disease (NCT06596005). We conducted a comprehensive safety assessment of TJ0113 in Sprague-Dawley rats and Beagle dogs under GLP. Single-dose studies (up to 1500 mg/kg, oral) and repeat-dose studies (rats: 15, 30, 100 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks; dogs: 6, 20, 60 mg/kg/day for 39 weeks) evaluated systemic toxicity, toxicokinetics (TK), safety pharmacology endpoints (including ECG), and a standard genotoxicity battery (Ames, chromosomal aberration, micronucleus) consistent with ICH S2(R1). No treatment-related mortality or target-organ toxicity occurred. A modest increase in relative kidney organ coefficient in rats was observed but without biochemical or histopathological correlates and was considered non-adverse. Clinical pathology, ECG, and dog urinalysis remained within physiological limits; all genotoxicity tests were negative. TK showed rapid absorption with linear, dose-proportional exposure and no accumulation at the end of dosing. The NOAELs were 100 mg/kg/day in rats (26 weeks) and 60 mg/kg/day in dogs (39 weeks). These data establish a favorable nonclinical safety profile for TJ0113 and provide GLP evidence supporting further clinical development of this selective mitophagy-targeting agent.Copyright © 2025.

    "title": "Polo-Like Kinase 1 Phosphorylation Tunes the Functional Viscoelastic Properties of the Centrosome Scaffold.",
    "abstract": "Cytoskeleton-organizing organelles often function while under mechanical load. The outer layer of centrosomes, called pericentriolar material (PCM), nucleates microtubules that move chromosomes during mitosis. How PCM resists microtubule-mediated forces is poorly understood at the material level. This study shows that PLK-1 phosphorylation of SPD-5 tunes the dynamics and material properties of the PCM scaffold in C. elegans embryos. Microrheology of reconstituted SPD-5 scaffolds reveals that PLK-1 phosphorylation decreases SPD-5 dynamics and increases scaffold viscoelasticity. Similarly, in embryos, phospho-mimetic SPD-5 is less dynamic than wild-type SPD-5, which itself is less dynamic than phospho-null SPD-5. PCM built with phospho-null SPD-5 is smaller than normal, but its assembly can be partially rescued by reducing microtubule-dependent forces. The same is true for PCM built with phospho-mimetic SPD-5, yet the underlying causes are distinct: under force, phospho-null SPD-5 fails to assemble, while phospho-mimetic SPD-5 forms hyper-stable foci that fail to cohere into a uniform, spherical mass. Both mutants have defects with chromosome segregation and viability. Thus, tuning of SPD-5 phosphorylation optimizes PCM material properties to achieve correct PCM size, integrity, and function. These results demonstrate how regulated chemical modification of a scaffolding protein tunes the material properties and function of a microtubule-organizing organelle.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "The simuliid fauna of Laos is among the most poorly known of any country in the world, only seven species having been recorded. We explored the Laotian simuliid fauna as an opportunity to test reproductive isolation and the minute morphological differences between two of the country's common isomorphic nominal species-Simulium chamlongi Takaoka & Suzuki (Diptera: Simuliidae) and Simulium luculentum Takaoka, Srisuka & Saeung (Diptera: Simuliidae). Both are members of the widespread Simulium variegatum group. Using the band patterns of the giant chromosomes in the larval silk glands, we showed that S. chamlongi and S. luculentum are reproductively isolated, no hybrids having been found. Molecular analyses indicated that the two species are genetically distinct, with a minimum genetic divergence of 2.91%. Analysis of a fragment of the vertebrate cytochrome b gene revealed that the blood hosts of S. chamlongi and S. luculentum in Laos include humans and water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis Linnaeus) (Artiodactyla: Bovidae), respectively. Diagnostic morphological characters provided in the original species descriptions were substantiated for pupae and females but not for larvae or males. Our chromosomal analyses also revealed a third reproductively isolated species, possibly new, with a unique IIS chromosomal sequence. The absence of a uniquely shared inversion among the three species indicates that the S. variegatum group lacks a defining chromosomal synapomorphy.© 2025 Royal Entomological Society.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays an important evolutionary role in prokaryotes, but it is less frequent in mammals. We previously reported that cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) - chromosomal fragments released from the billions of dying cells that circulate in human blood - are horizontally transferred to healthy cells with biological effects. However, the underlying mechanism and function of these effects remained unclear. We treated NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts cells with cfChPs isolated from human serum and serially passaged the cells. The intracellular activities of cfChPs were analysed using chromatin fibre fluorography, cytogenetic analysis, immunofluorescence, and fluorescent in situ hybridisation. We discovered that the internalised cfChPs were almost exclusively comprised of non-coding DNA, and the disparate DNA sequences contained within them had randomly combined to form complex concatemers, some of which were multi-mega base pairs in size. The concatemers autonomously performed many functions attributable to the nuclear genome such as DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. They harboured human LINE-1 and Alu elements, with the potential to rearrange themselves within the mouse genome. Our results suggest that a cell simultaneously harbours two autonomous genome forms: one that is inherited (hereditary genome) and numerous others that are acquired (satellite genomes). The satellite genomes may have evolutionary functions given their ability to serve as vehicles for transposable elements and to generate a plethora of novel proteins. Our results also suggest that 'within-self' HGT may occur in mammals on a massive scale via the medium of cfChP concatemers that have undergone extensive and complex modifications resulting in their behaviour as 'foreign' genetic elements.© 2024, Banerjee, Shende, Kata et al.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae is a serious public health threat due to its propensity to develop antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the emergence of hypervirulent strains able to cause community-acquired infections, and the more recent development of convergent strains that exhibit both traits. Pathogenesis in K. pneumoniae is attributed to a range of largely horizontally-acquired virulence or fitness factors that collectively mediate immune evasion, attachment, intermicrobial competition and nutrition in different niches within the host. An outstanding research question is how expression of these factors is coordinated during infection, and how this regulatory control varies in genomically distinct lineages. Here we review recent progress in understanding the regulators and networks that control K. pneumoniae virulence or host fitness factor expression, discuss the role of plasmid-chromosome regulatory crosstalk in pathogenesis, and explore the potential of new global approaches to enhance our understanding. This knowledge will be instrumental in accurately predicting virulence from genome sequence in new emergent K. pneumoniae lineages, in order to track and manage this priority pathogen.Copyright: © 2025 Nguyen et al.

The feasibility and potential added value of prenatal assessment of the vertebral pattern and the presence of cervical ribs is currently unclear. Aims of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of prenatal assessment of the fetal vertebral pattern and cervical ribs using three-dimensional ultrasound and determine whether an abnormal vertebral pattern is associated with adverse fetal and neonatal outcome.1138 Women referred for an advanced ultrasound examination were included and volume data sets of the spine were acquired. The vertebral pattern was reassessed on postnatal radiographic examinations, when available. Associations between adverse outcomes and abnormalities of the vertebral pattern that had at least a good agreement between prenatal and postnatal assessments were studied.Agreement between prenatal and postnatal assessment of the presence of cervical ribs was poor, which also applied to assessment of the complete vertebral pattern. Moderate to fair agreement existed between prenatal and postnatal assessments of thoracic rib number. Prenatal and postnatal assessments of lumbar ribs had a very good agreement. Lumbar ribs were rare (10/768, 1.3%) and associated with female gender, but not with any other variable.Lumbar ribs could be assessed very well on prenatal three-dimensional ultrasound and were not associated with adverse outcomes. Prenatal and postnatal agreement between the presence of cervical ribs, number of thoracic ribs and the vertebral pattern was insufficient.The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.",

    "title": "Unveiling the Evolutionary History and Functional Significance of the Protein Z-Dependent Protease Inhibitor (ZPI) Across Vertebrates.",
    "abstract": "Serpins, characterized by a conserved structural fold, serve diverse biological roles. Protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI), a serpin superfamily member, acts as an endogenous anticoagulant by inhibiting clotting factors Xa (fXa) and XIa (fXIa). Beyond anticoagulation, ZPI has roles in inflammation, cancer, and immune regulation. However, its exact pathophysiological role is yet to be fully characterized. To elucidate ZPI's evolutionary trajectory and non-haemostatic roles, we conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis integrating sequence, gene structure, and synteny data. We identified a lamprey-specific serpin, ZPIL_AGTL_PMA, containing both an inhibitory reactive center loop (RCL) and an angiotensin II (Ang II) motif. This finding suggests that ZPIL_AGTL_PMA represents an ancestral bifunctional serpin from which ZPI and angiotensinogen (AGT), a non-inhibitory serpin involved in blood pressure regulation, evolved by sub-functionalization in jawed vertebrates. This bifunctionality within a single gene in lamprey likely reflects an ancestral vertebrate trait. Gene cluster analyses showed serpinA10 (ZPI) as possibly the earliest member, with other Clade A serpins arising via subsequent duplication. The chromosomal location of this gene cluster is conserved in most vertebrates, except Carnivores and Suidea. Sequence analysis indicated potential non-inhibitory ZPI variants in certain species with atypical non-serine residues at the P1' position within its RCL, a critical determinant of inhibitory serpin activity. The close evolutionary relationship between ZPI and AGT further suggests mechanistic interplay between coagulation and blood pressure regulation, highlighting shared regulatory pathways involving these serpins. Together, these findings expand the functional landscape of ZPI and underscore the dynamic evolution of serpin-mediated physiological processes.© 2025.

    "abstract": "Rice blast, caused by the ascomycete fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most problematic diseases for rice production, threatening global food security. Genetic resistance to some M. oryzae races can be achieved using major resistance genes containing the corresponding avirulence (AVR) genes. Weedy rice, a close relative of cultivated rice that competes with the crop, has evolved unique genetic mechanisms to resist the infections of M. oryzae; thus, weedy rice can serve as an excellent resource for blast control. In this study, we assessed disease scores of 183 F5 and F6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a weedy rice × crop biparental mapping population and their parental lines, a Black Hull Awn weedy rice strain (PI 653413, RR14) and the aus-196 rice variety, using four blast races IB33, IG1, IE1K and ICI7 under greenhouse conditions. All the parental lines were resistant to all blast races; however, RILs showed a wide degree of variation in resistance. Genotyping-by-sequencing of the RIL population and parents generated 1498 SNPs which were used to construct a linkage map, and QTL mapping of blast resistance was performed using r/qtl. A single major blast resistance QTL on chromosome 12 was mapped to the Pi-ta/Pi39(t)/Ptr locus. Identification of the Pi-ta/Pi-t39(t)/Ptr as the key contributor to blast resistance in weedy rice provides insight into the evolution and adaptation of weedy rice and can aid in development of blast resistant rice varieties through marker-assisted selection.",

    "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a lethal cancer of the bile duct and is a major health concern in several parts of the world, including northeastern Thailand, where CCA incidence is the highest due to the endemic liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini. Multiple studies have characterised genomic alterations in CCA tumours, and specific chromosomal alterations can predict prognosis. However, it is not known whether chromosomal instability (CIN), ongoing genomic alteration characteristic of most cancer types, is present in CCA tumours. In this study we leveraged a panel of cancer cell lines derived from fluke-positive CCA patients, as well as a matched normal cholangiocyte line as a control, to characterise CIN in CCA. We observed elevated rates of chromosome segregation errors compared to normal cells, although overall CIN rates were lower than those for highly genomically unstable cancers, such as colorectal or ovarian cancer. Chromosome segregation errors in CCA cell lines were potentially driven by elevated DNA replication stress and centrosome duplication. Single-cell genome sequencing and karyotyping of the cell lines showed extensive structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations, as well as copy number alterations that were heterogeneous between individual cells, supporting the presence of ongoing CIN in these cell line models. Low-pass whole-genome sequencing of 33 CCA tumour samples with matched normal tissue from northeastern Thailand, a liver fluke-endemic region showed increased whole and subchromosomal level alterations, with a higher extent of genomic alterations in intrahepatic tumours compared to extrahepatic. Eight tumours carried focal amplifications and/or deletions involving known cancer genes, as well as potential chromosomal instability-associated genes, including CCNE1 amplifications and a rare amplification of BRCA1. This study provides increased understanding of the rate and potential mechanisms of CIN in CCA that may inform new therapeutic strategies that synergise with specific ongoing CIN mechanisms. © 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification and characterization of intracellular proteins with antiviral activity (known as restriction factors) is a key first step towards the future development of novel host-directed antiviral therapies. In this study, we investigated the antiviral activity of 14 different interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) proteins against SARS-CoV-2. Overexpression of human guanylate binding protein (GBP) 1 resulted in potent inhibition of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain, as well as against Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2 variants of concern (VOCs). Moreover, knockdown or knockout of endogenous human GBP1 resulted in enhanced titers of SARS-CoV-2. While hGBP1 can restrict some viruses via actin remodeling, our data indicate that this is not the mechanism here. Moreover, we show that unlike GBP2 and GBP5, which impair spike protein processing, GBP1 did not reduce infectivity of spike-pseudotyped viruses following titration on Caco-2 cells. Multiple human GBPs have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro; however, we report no significant differences in virus titers recovered from the upper or lower airways of SARS-CoV-2-infected wild-type mice compared to from mice lacking the chromosome 3 cluster of mouse GBPs (GBP1/2/3/5/7). Together, our studies describe the ability of human GBP1 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, highlighting this host protein as a potential target for the development of host-directed antiviral therapies against this virus.IMPORTANCEViruses like SARS-CoV-2 can cause widespread illness and death. While currently licensed antiviral drugs are critical tools, drug resistance can develop. Our immune system produces intracellular proteins called \"restriction factors\" that can limit virus replication within cells. These proteins are promising targets for developing new antiviral therapies. In this study, we identified one such protein, human GBP1, which inhibited a range of SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro, including Delta and Omicron. Interestingly, GBP1 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 through a different mechanism to that of other human GBPs as it did not interfere with prosessing of the viral spike protein. Of interest, a cluster of mouse GBPs, including GBP1, did not demontrate significant antiviral activity in a mouse model of infection. Overall, our findings suggest that human GBP1 could be a valuable target for host-directed antiviral strategies and highlight the limitations of using mouse models to study certain aspects of human innate immunity.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free DNA screening (cfDNA), also referred to as noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS), is utilized to screen for fetal chromosomal aneuploidies during pregnancy, including sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs). All patients within our center are offered diagnostic testing following a positive cfDNA for an SCA, but not all patients pursue this testing. This retrospective chart review aims to improve understanding of how often patients undergo confirmatory diagnostic testing when cfDNA is positive or inconclusive for an SCA and the pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy termination and live birth rates. We also describe the outcomes of cases where patients had a normal cfDNA result; however, the cfDNA-predicted fetal sex is discrepant from the ultrasound-predicted fetal sex. The study found that 56 patients had a positive or inconclusive cfDNA for SCA, and 36/56 (64.3%) pursued confirmatory testing either via prenatal (19 patients) or postnatal (17 patients) diagnostic testing. For the cases where confirmatory diagnostic information was available, an SCA was confirmed in 16/36 (44.4%). A birthing parent SCA was discovered to be the likely cause of a positive cfDNA in two cases. The positive predictive value (PPV) of cfDNA was 41.7% for all SCAs, 27.8% for Turner syndrome, 50.0% for triple X syndrome, 100% for Klinefelter syndrome, 100% for Jacobs syndrome, and 0% for inconclusive results. Nine patients had a negative cfDNA; however, the cfDNA-predicted fetal chromosomal sex was discrepant from the fetal phenotypic sex predicted by ultrasound. In 3/9 cases, this led to a fetal ascertainment of a difference of sex development (DSD), which would not have been possible without the cfDNA result.© 2025 The Author(s).

    "abstract": "Turner syndrome (TS) is the most common sex chromosome abnormality disorder, caused by complete or partial absence of the X chromosome, its clinical manifestations primarily include short stature, gonadal dysgenesis, and characteristic cardiovascular malformations, pediatric cardiologists pay particular attention to coarctation of the aorta (CoA), which occurs in 15%-30% of TS patients and represents a life-threatening condition requiring prioritized screening during the neonatal and childhood periods (1- 3). Furthermore, due to lymphatic system developmental abnormalities, TS patients also face elevated risks of aortic root dilation, bicuspid aortic valve, and vascular structural anomalies (3). Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is a rare pulmonary vascular anomaly, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 50,000 in the general population (1-3). Although the exact prevalence of PAVM in TS patients remains unclear, case series suggest a significantly elevated risk compared to the general population (estimated risk ratio: 5- to 10-fold), this association may be attributed to defective vascular elastic fiber development and dysregulated angiogenic signaling pathways in TS patients (4, 5). Here, we report the first documented case of TS complicated by PAVM, aiming to enhance clinicians' awareness of this rare comorbidity and provide evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations.© 2025 Guo, Chen, Chen and Tang.",

    "abstract": "To assess the diagnostic efficacy of echocardiography, chromosome karyotyping, and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) in congenital cardiac anomalies.This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 3,386 pregnant women who underwent echocardiography and amniocentesis at the Sichuan Provincial Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital between January 2020 and August 2022. The study group included 697 women whose fetuses were diagnosed with congenital heart disease (CHD) by echocardiography, while the comparison group included 2,689 women with normal echocardiographic results. The diagnostic contributions of echocardiography, karyotyping, and CMA were compared between the two groups.Among the 697 cases diagnosed with CHD, the most common types were ventricular septal defect (44.45%) and valve abnormalities (40.66%). Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 41 out of 629 CHD cases (6.52%) by karyotyping, with higher rates in complex CHD (16.36%) and CHD with extracardiac anomalies (23.08%) compared to the comparison group (4.71%). CMA identified 34 pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) (5.28%) and 9 variants of unknown significance (VOUS) (1.40%) in 644 CHD cases, with higher CNV detection rates in complex CHD (7.69%) and CHD with extracardiac anomalies (7.69%) compared to the comparison group (1.38%). CMA further identified pathogenic CNVs in 4.42% (26/588) of CHD cases with a normal karyotype, yielding an incremental diagnostic rate of 4.42%.Echocardiography remains the cornerstone for the prenatal detection of fetal heart malformations. When combined with karyotyping and CMA, this integrated approach achieves maximal detection of both macroscopic and submicroscopic genomic alterations-particularly in complex cardiac malformations or when extracardiac anomalies coexist-thereby delivering timely, comprehensive genetic information to guide early intervention and tailored perinatal counseling.Copyright © 2025 Yin, Zhang, Wang, Cao, Ou, Zhao, Xu, Wang, Xia, Zhang, Xiao, Luo and Wang.",

In this study, we observed its leaf cross-cut characteristics under a microscope and spore morphology characteristics under a scanning electron microscope, counted its chromosome number, and compared population genetic differences between this hexaploid and I. orientalis based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) extracted from whole-genome resequencing data. We found that this hexaploid differs from I. orientalis in both leaf morphology and spore ornamentation, and that the two also exhibit significant differences in population genetics. Based on this comprehensive evidence, we identified the hexaploid as a new species and named it I. fokiensis.

However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. This study examines the mechanism of ZSCAN9 in HCC and analyze its expression, prognostic value, clinical relevance, immune correlation, signaling pathways, and drug sensitivity, thus providing new insights into its potential as a therapeutic target for HCC.The Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) 2.0 database was used to analyze the pancancer expression of ZSCAN9, its differential expression between tumor and normal tissues, and the associations with overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Additionally, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases, along with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), were used to analyze the pathways, immune levels, and drug sensitivity related to ZSCAN9's involvement in HCC.ZSCAN9 was differentially expressed in HCC, with its high expression being associated with poor prognosis (P<0.05). ZSCAN9 was also correlated with several biological functions, such as DNA replication, G2M checkpoint, tumor proliferation, DNA repair (R>0.3; P<0.05), and fatty acid degradation (R<-0.3; P<0.05). The results of immune correlation analysis showed that ZSCAN9 was positively correlated with the abundance of T helper cells (R>0.2; P<0.05) and negatively correlated with that of dendritic cells (DCs), cytotoxic cells, neutrophils, plasmacytoid DCs, B cells, and interdigitating DCs (R<-0.2; P<0.05). ZSCAN9 was positively correlated with CD274 level (R=0.29), and the results of drug sensitivity analysis indicated that patients with high ZSCAN9 were more responsive to several drugs, including sorafenib, 5-fluorouracil, etoposide, and AKT inhibitor VIII, as compared to those with low expression.ZSCAN9 may be a biological target capable of predicting recurrence and survival time in patients with HCC and may be involved in the regulation of angiogenesis; moreover, its expression may influence the drug sensitivity of sorafenib, 5-fluorouracil, etoposide, and AKT inhibitor VIII.Copyright © 2025 AME Publishing Company.

    "abstract": "Environmental factors play a role in the pathogenesis of complex traits including atopic eczema (AE) and a greater understanding of gene-environment interactions (G*E) is needed to define pathomechanisms for disease prevention. We analysed data from 16 European studies to test for interaction between the 24 most significant AE-associated loci identified from genome-wide association studies and 18 early-life environmental factors. We tested for replication using a further 10 studies and in vitro modelling to independently assess findings.The discovery analysis showed suggestive evidence for interaction (p<0.05) between 7 environmental factors (antibiotic use, cat ownership, dog ownership, breastfeeding, elder sibling, smoking and washing practices) and at least one established variant for AE, 14 interactions in total (maxN=25,339). In replication analysis (maxN=252,040) dog exposure*rs10214237 (on chromosome 5p13.2 near IL7R) was nominally significant (ORinteraction=0.91 [0.83-0.99] P=0.025), with a risk effect of the T allele observed only in those not exposed to dogs. A similar interaction with rs10214237 was observed for siblings in the discovery analysis (ORinteraction=0.84[0.75-0.94] P=0.003), but replication analysis was under-powered ORinteraction=1.09[0.82-1.46]). Rs10214237 homozygous risk genotype is associated with lower IL-7R expression in human keratinocytes, and dog exposure modelled in vitro showed a differential response according to rs10214237 genotype.Interaction analysis and functional assessment provide evidence that early-life dog exposure may modify the genetic effect of rs10214237 on AE via IL7R, supporting observational epidemiology showing a protective effect for dog ownership.

We developed a Ribosome Variation Analysis (RiboVAn) method, identifying both heritable germline variants and a larger proportion of low-heritability, likely somatic variants. The most heritable variants cluster within four ESs of the 28S rRNA, with specific variants in es15l associated with adiposity, es39l linked to body dimensions, and es27l associated with blood-related traits and diseases. Variant-chromosome specificity is observed where functional variants are linked to certain rDNA chromosomes.

    "abstract": "Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is one of the most common soft tissue tumors in children and is primarily classified into two subtypes: alveolar (ARMS) and embryonal (ERMS). Among these, ARMS is the more aggressive form, often driven by chromosomal translocations that give rise to PAX3/7-FOXO1 fusion proteins, which act as oncogenic transcription factors. Despite advancements in treatment and improved survival rates over recent years, effective and targeted therapies for RMS remain a significant clinical challenge. A family of proteins known as the DEAD-box RNA helicases plays a critical role in RNA metabolism as well as in a variety of cellular processes beyond RNA regulation. Among them, DDX5 has emerged as a protein of particular interest. Aberrant expression and functional alterations of DDX5 have been reported in multiple cancers, including RMS, where its overexpression is associated with enhanced tumor growth and cancer cell proliferation. In this review, we highlight recent discoveries that position DDX5 as a promising therapeutic target in RMS, focusing on its oncogenic functions and its contribution to tumorigenesis and cancer progression.Copyright © 2025 Bianconi and Mozzetta.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplication (WGD) has had profound macroevolutionary impacts on diverse lineages, preceding adaptive radiations in vertebrates, teleost fish, and angiosperms. In contrast to the many known ancient WGDs in animals and especially plants, we are aware of evidence for only four in fungi. The oldest of these occurred ~100 million years ago (mya) and is shared by ~60 extant Saccharomycetales species, including the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Notably, this is the only known ancient WGD in the yeast subphylum Saccharomycotina. The dearth of ancient WGD events in fungi remains a mystery. Some studies have suggested that fungal lineages that experience chromosome and genome duplication quickly go extinct, leaving no trace in the genomic record, while others contend that the lack of known WGD is due to an absence of data. Under the second hypothesis, additional sampling and deeper sequencing of fungal genomes should lead to the discovery of more WGD events. Coupling hundreds of recently published genomes from nearly every described Saccharomycotina species with three additional long-read assemblies, we discovered three novel WGD events. While the functions of retained duplicate genes originating from these events are broad, they bear many similarities to the well-known WGD that occurred in the Saccharomycetales. Our results suggest that WGD may be a more common evolutionary force in fungi than previously believed.",

    "abstract": "ACTL6a is an essential component of SWI/SNF and expressed on the chromosome 3q26 cytoband, which is amplified in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). While ACTL6A is emerging as an oncogene, its role as a treatment target and mechanisms of transcription factor induction remain unknown. Here, we show that ACTL6A expression is a mediator of the Warburg effect, with ACTL6A knockdown inducing mitochondrial dependency and significantly decreasing levels of aerobic glycolysis. These effects lead to near complete attenuation of hypoxic cell growth by blunting induction of HIF1α and HIF2α protein expression. They also sensitize treatment resistant HNSCC cells to the tumor killing effects of the complex I inhibitor IACS-010759 in vivo. Using ATAC-seq, we identify ACTL6A as a mediator of chromatin accessibility of AP-1 transcription factor sites and find that it regulates upstream MAPK signaling through induction Ras and Galectin-1. These effects sensitize ACTL6A over-expressing cells to inhibition of glycolysis by MEK inhibitors. Our results link SWI/SNF subunit amplification with potentiation of MAPK signaling in HNSCC and provide a novel mechanism by which cancer cells drive aerobic glycolysis and reduce mitochondrial dependency. We leverage these findings to propose treatment strategies for hypoxic tumors with SWI/SNF subunit amplifications.",

The newest element is a chromatin jet, a diffused line perpendicular to the main diagonal in the Hi-C contact map, which was reported in quiescent mammalian lymphocytes supporting a two-sided symmetric cohesin loop extrusion model. A similar structure is observed in Repli-HiC data, where relatively thin and straight chromatin fountains indicate coupling of DNA replication forks. However, the precise biological implications of these jet-like structures are unknown due to the limitations in computational methods. We developed MIA-Jet, a multi-scale ridge detection algorithm that can accurately detect jets of variable lengths, widths, and angles. When tested on Hi-C, Repli-HiC, ChIA-PET, ChIA-Drop, and Micro-C data in mouse, human, roundworm, and zebrafish cells, MIA-Jet outperformed existing methods. In human cells, jets were enriched in cohesin loading sites and early replication initiation zones. Applying MIA-Jet to Hi-C data generated from protein-degraded cells revealed that jets are dependent on cohesin but not YY1, and jet signals are strengthened after depleting WAPL. We envision MIA-Jet to be broadly applicable to any 3D genome mapping data, thereby providing new insights into the functional roles of chromatin jets.",

Here, using in vivo gene replacement, we investigated the causes and consequences underlying the rapid evolution of protamine Mst77F, which is essential for male fertility in D. melanogaster. Mst77F ortholog replacements led to defects in DNA compaction of X-chromosome-bearing sperm compared to Y-chromosome-bearing sperm during spermatogenesis, resulting in fewer X-bearing mature sperm and male-biased progeny. Unlike D. melanogaster, Mst77F is not essential for male fertility in D. yakuba but is still required to suppress sex-ratio distortion.

    "abstract": "X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI), driven by the expression of Xist RNA and the enrichment of various repressive epigenetic marks, results in the formation of a mostly inactive X chromosome (Xi) to equalize X-linked gene expression between sexes. Unexpectedly, in unstimulated female lymphocytes that are largely quiescent, these epigenetic features are largely absent but are restored by NF-κB signaling following their activation. To determine whether these epigenetic phenotypes correlate with quiescence or NF-κB activation in other tissues, we evaluated female progenitor and stem cells from intestine, blood, and muscle. Despite known NF-κB activation, intestinal progenitors have variable Xist RNA patterns, whereas blood progenitors and neutrophils show a strong correlation between NF-κB activation status and Xist RNA localization. In contrast, muscle satellite cells (SCs) and myoblasts exhibit Xist RNA accumulation at the Xi without NF-κB activation. Xist RNA localization patterns in SCs change with age, yet adult SCs have an Xi that is mostly transcriptionally silent while allowing expression of muscle-specific X-linked genes including Dmd . These findings reveal that female somatic cells employ diverse, tissue-specific epigenetic mechanisms to maintain X chromosome inactivation, enabling cell type specific Xi gene expression while preserving chromosome-wide silencing.",

    "abstract": "Dps is the most abundant nucleoid-associated protein in starved Escherichia coli with ∼180, 000 copies per cell. Dps binds DNA and oxidises iron, facilitating survival in harsh environments. Dps-DNA complexes can form crystalline structures, leading to the proposed model that Dps reorganises the starved E. coli nucleoid into a compact liquid crystal, slowing chromosome dynamics and limiting access of other proteins to DNA. In this work, we directly tested this model using live-cell super-resolution microscopy and Hi-C analysis. We found that after 96 h of starvation, Dps compacts the nucleoid and increases short-range DNA-DNA interactions, but does not affect chromosome accessibility to large protein nanocages or small restriction enzymes. We also report that chromosome dynamics and organisation are primarily impacted by the bacterial growth phase; the effect of Dps is relatively minor. Our work clarifies the role of Dps in modulating nucleoid properties, and we propose an updated model for Dps-DNA interactions in which Dps binds, protects and compacts DNA largely without influencing chromosome access, dynamics and organisation. Additionally, this work provides a general framework for assessing the impact of nucleoid-associated proteins on key aspects of chromosome function in live cells.",

    "abstract": "During cell division, chromosomes reorganise into compact bodies in which centromeres localise precisely at the chromatin surface to enable kinetochore-microtubule interactions essential for genome segregation. The physical principles guiding this centromere positioning remain unknown. Here, we reveal that human core centromeres are directed to the chromatin surface by repulsion of centromere-associated proteins - independent of condensin-mediated loop extrusion and microtubule engagement. Using cellular perturbations, biochemical reconstitution, and multiscale molecular dynamics simulations, we show that chromatin surface localisation emerges from repulsion between condensed chromatin and both the kinetochore and the highly negatively charged centromere protein, CENP-B. Together, these elements form a centromeric region composed of two domains with opposing affinities, one favouring integration within the mitotic chromosome and the other favouring exposure to the surrounding cytoplasm, thereby driving surface positioning. Tethering synthetic negatively charged proteins to chromatin was sufficient to recapitulate this surface localisation in cells and in vitro, indicating that electrostatic repulsion is a key determinant of surface localisation. These findings demonstrate that centromere layering is not hardwired by chromatin folding patterns but instead emerges from phase separation in chromatin. Our work uncovers electrostatic polarity as a general and programmable mechanism to spatially organise chromatin.",

To identify neurodevelopmental processes that might present sex-biased vulnerability, we generated transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles of cell types present in the prenatally developing human cerebral cortex of 27 males and 21 females. By intersecting sex-biased molecular signatures and genes with de novo mutations in male and female autistic probands, we reveal two points of vulnerability contributing to the sex-biased penetrance in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). First, we show that NDD risk genes are biased towards higher expression in females, identifying the NDD gene MEF2C as a critical transcription factor for female-biased expression. Second, we identify a significant contribution of X chromosome genes to NDD pathobiology. We construct a gene regulatory map of X-linked risk genes to enable functional studies of genetic variants that likely disrupt gene expression in the developing brains of autistic males. Together, these results point towards an outsized contribution of the X-chromosome to both the origin of sex differences in the developing human cortex and NDD vulnerability. We propose a model where female-biased vulnerability is driven by coding variation within genes while male-biased vulnerability is driven by noncoding variation in regulatory elements that affect gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The Aurora B kinase-containing Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) is an essential regulator of cytokinesis, the final and irreversible step of cell division. During anaphase, the CPC concentrates at the spindle midzone - a bundle of overlapping antiparallel microtubules organized at the cell center. How CPC is selectively enriched at the midzone within the dense, heterogeneous, and dynamic spindle microtubule network is unknown. Here, we define a minimal CPC midzone enrichment module. We show that the maximal enrichment of CPC at antiparallel microtubule overlaps requires PRC1-crosslinked microtubules and the interaction of CPC with two mitotic kinesins, KIF4A and KIF20A. We find that the two motors exhibit a division of labor: KIF20A delivers CPC from non-overlapping microtubules, and KIF4A retains CPC at PRC1-crosslinked overlaps. Conditional depletion of KIF4A in mitotic cells reveals that it is required for CPC localization at the spindle midzone in anaphase. Taken together, our findings reveal how the collective activity of two kinesins enables navigation through the complex microtubule network of the spindle to organize kinase signaling at the cell center for cytokinesis.",

    "title": "Tunable Low-Rate Genomic Recombination with Cre-lox in Escherichia coli : A Versatile Tool for Environmental Biosensing and Synthetic Biology.",
    "abstract": "The ability to induce heritable genomic changes in response to environmental cues is valuable for environmental biosensing, for experimentally probing microbial ecology and evolution, and for synthetic biology applications. Site-specific recombinases provide a route to genetic memory via targeted DNA modifications, but their high specificity and efficiency are offset by leaky expression and limited tunability in prokaryotes. We developed a tightly regulated, titratable Cre recombinase system for Escherichia coli that achieves low recombination rates and minimal basal activity. Implemented on both plasmids and the chromosome, the latter showed superior retention of genetic memory across generations. These features make the system broadly useful for environmental biosensing and other applications. To demonstrate applicability to environmental biosensing, we developed a whole-cell recombination-based biosensor for arsenite, a toxic and ubiquitous pollutant that is primarily mobilized in anoxic environments such as flooded soils, sediments, and aquifers. However, existing arsenite whole-cell biosensors face limitations in sensitivity and workflow in anaerobic settings. Our biosensor reliably recorded anoxic arsenite exposure as a stable genetic memory for delayed fluorescence readout in aerobic conditions, with detection sensitivity comparable to conventional wet chemical methods. By decoupling exposure from measurement, this approach offers a foundation for arsenite biosensing under field-relevant conditions, including redox variability and other physicochemical gradients, without the constraints of anoxic measurement. More broadly, the ability to induce low-rate, heritable genetic changes expands the genetic toolkit for environmentally responsive systems, with applications in environmental monitoring, bioproduction, bioengineering, as well as experimental studies of microbial ecology, evolution, and host-microbe interactions.Arsenic is a toxic and globally prevalent pollutant, mobilized primarily under anoxic conditions where detection is challenging. Whole-cell biosensors offer a promising route for monitoring bioavailable arsenic in situ , but their development has largely focused on aerobic conditions, with anoxic assays limited by sensitivity and workflow constraints. Genetic tools that enable heritable, low-frequency genomic changes in bacteria can expand biosensor capabilities by recording transient exposures and supporting applications in environmental monitoring, synthetic biology, and quantitative microbial population dynamics research. Here, we developed a tightly regulated, chemically inducible Cre- lox system in Escherichia coli that enables recombination at low, tunable rates. We demonstrate its utility by constructing an arsenite biosensor that reliably detects low concentrations and records exposures under both aerobic and anoxic conditions. This approach is broadly applicable for biosensors designed for field deployment and for experiments investigating microbial ecology and evolution, where controllable genetic diversification may be desirable.",

    "title": "SimHumanity: Using SLiM 5.0 to run whole-genome simulations of human evolution.",
    "abstract": "The reconstruction of human evolutionary history has undergone repeated advances, each made possible by methodological innovations. In recent decades, genetic and genomic data played a central role in the reconstruction of major evolutionary events such as the out-of-Africa migration, and genetic simulations of human evolutionary history have come to play a major role in testing more specific hypotheses including proposed patterns of migration and admixture with archaic hominins. Increasing computational power has allowed human evolutionary history to be modeled at ever-larger scales, but simulations that encompass the complete human genome, including sex chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA, have been difficult due to the lack of support for whole-genome models in commonly used evolutionary simulation frameworks. With the recent introduction of SLiM 5 such simulations are now straightforward to construct, allowing the easy simulation of humans at whole-genome scale under different demographic models and evolutionary dynamics. We here present three versions of a reusable, customizable, open-source SLiM 5 model for simulating the molecular evolution of the full human genome. We also show some simple analyses of results from the model, to illustrate its utility. We hope this model, which we have nicknamed \"SimHumanity\" in jest, will facilitate further progress in the field of human evolutionary simulations.",

    "abstract": "Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by various clinical features. The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular diagnostic and clinical features of BWS in Chinese pediatric patients.This retrospective study reviewed the clinical data of 24 pediatric patients diagnosed with BWS at the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University from 2014 to 2024. To assess genetic abnormalities, molecular analysis was performed using array comparative genomic hybridization (Array-CGH) as well as methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA).With a range of fetal period to four years, the median age at diagnosis was nine months. Cardinal features were macroglossia (95.8%), lateralized overgrowth (54.2%), and omphalocele (25%). Suggestive features included transient hypoglycemia (20.8%), hepatomegaly or nephromegaly (8.3%), and facial port-wine stain or ear-lobe creases (8.3%). Molecular analysis revealed that 57.9% of patients had methylation abnormalities in the imprinting control region 2 (IC2), while 5.3% had abnormalities in imprinting control region 1 (IC1), and 36.8% diagnosed with uniparental disomy (UPD). One patient also exhibited a rare homozygous mutation in the DUOX2 gene and a heterozygous mutation in the LDLR gene.This study investigates the significance of early genetic testing in the clinical and molecular features of pediatric BWS demonstrating that MLPA exhibits its higher sensitivity and specificity for genetic testing in these patients. Furthermore, the findings identified a high prevalence of UPD in the southern Chinese population and highlighted the diagnostic role of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) in detecting UPD-related phenotypes in patients with BWS.Copyright © 2025 AME Publishing Company.

    "title": "Discovery of a novel class NSD2 inhibitor for multiple myeloma with t(4;14).",
    "abstract": "The prognosis for multiple myeloma (MM) has continued to improve with the development of a series of novel molecular targeted drugs over time. However, the prognosis remains poor for cases with high-risk chromosomal abnormalities. Of such abnormalities, t(4;14) is the second most common, occurring in 15% of patients with MM. MM cells carrying t(4;14) strongly express histone methyltransferase with a SET domain, called NSD2, making them resistant to drugs against MM. Therefore, NSD2 is a promising therapeutic target for MM carrying t(4;14). Subsequently, we performed high-throughput screening and identified RK-0080552 (RK-552) as a novel class NSD2 inhibitor. RK-552 was significantly cytotoxic against t(4;14)+ MM compared with t(4;14)- MM cells in vitro and in vivo via transcriptional suppression of the IRF4 gene, coincided with a decrease in histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation. Moreover, RK-552 acted additively with pomalidomide in vitro and prolonged the survival of recipient mice without side effects. These results suggest that RK-552 may be a clinically relevant NSD2 inhibitor with specific cytotoxicity to MM cells carrying t(4;14). Our study also provides a molecular basis and rationale for the inclusion in current treatment strategies. Therefore, the clinical use of RK-552 may significantly improve the treatment outcome of MM with t(4;14).© 2025 American Society of Hematology. Published by Elsevier Inc.
