# The Orchid Continuum - Digital Platform Project

## Overview

The Orchid Continuum is a project of the Five Cities Orchid Society providing enhanced digital tools for an improved online orchid society member experience. This AI-enhanced orchid database and community management system consolidates orchid photos and metadata from multiple sources for integration into the society's main website. It provides automated data ingestion, AI-powered orchid identification, and real-time web widgets for orchid enthusiasts and researchers.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask web application with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: SQLite (default) with support for PostgreSQL via environment configuration

- Advanced search functionality across multiple fields
- Filterable gallery with pagination
- Featured orchid system and "Orchid of the Day" widget

### 7. Admin Dashboard
- Upload validation and moderation
- Database statistics and management
- Scraping log monitoring

## Data Flow

1. **Input Sources**:
   - User photo uploads via web interface
   - Automated web scraping from orchid websites
   - Legacy form submissions and taxonomy files

2. **Processing Pipeline**:
   - File validation and secure storage
   - AI analysis for metadata extraction
   - Taxonomy matching and normalization
   - Database storage with logging

3. **Output Systems**:
   - Web gallery and search interfaces
   - Real-time widgets (Orchid of the Day)
   - Admin dashboard for management

## External Dependencies

### APIs and Services
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4o model for image analysis and text processing
- **Google Drive API**: Cloud storage for orchid images
- **Web Scraping Targets**: Gary Yong Gee and Roberta Fox orchid websites

### Python Libraries
- **Flask**: Web framework and routing
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM and migrations
- **Pillow**: Image processing and manipulation
- **BeautifulSoup/trafilatura**: Web content extraction
- **Werkzeug**: File upload security and utilities

### Frontend Libraries
- **Bootstrap 5**: UI framework with dark theme
- **Feather Icons**: Icon system
- **JavaScript**: Enhanced interactivity and AJAX functionality

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: SQLite database with debug mode enabled
- **Production**: PostgreSQL database via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **API Keys**: Environment variables for OpenAI and Google Drive credentials

### File Structure Organization
- Centralized folder structure for different data sources
- Automated categorization of scraped content, user uploads, and processed metadata
- Google Drive integration for scalable cloud storage

### Scaling Considerations
- Database connection pooling with automatic reconnection
