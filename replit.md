# The Orchid Continuum - Digital Platform Project

## Overview

The Orchid Continuum is a comprehensive research-grade digital platform focused on orchid research and community management. It integrates authoritative taxonomy databases, AI-powered image analysis, and ecological pattern correlation discovery. The platform aims to consolidate orchid data from diverse sources, provide automated data ingestion, AI-driven identification, and real-time web widgets for enthusiasts and researchers. 

**IMPORTANT: All climate activism features have been permanently disabled for user protection. This is now a legitimate academic botanical research platform only.**

**NEW FOCUS: Student Research Inspiration** - The platform now serves as an academic research hub designed to inspire the next generation of researchers in mycorrhizal networks, AI-biology interfaces, and orchid conservation. The goal is to provide legitimate research opportunities that could attract student researchers and academic partnerships.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a Bootstrap 5 dark theme with custom orchid-themed styling and Feather Icons for a consistent UI. Interactive features are enabled via JavaScript, including image previews and lazy loading. A significant UI component is the interactive 3D globe with a 35th parallel overlay, illustrating orchid hotspots and educational content. The system also includes responsive design for mobile optimization and features like "Orchid of the Day" widgets.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is built with Flask and SQLAlchemy ORM, supporting SQLite by default with PostgreSQL for production. AI integration leverages OpenAI GPT-4o for image analysis and metadata extraction. Google Drive API is used for cloud storage, and web scraping is automated using `trafilatura` and `BeautifulSoup`. Frontend uses Jinja2 templates. Database schema employs `OrchidTaxonomy` for classification and `OrchidRecord` for detailed metadata. Key features include AI-powered image analysis with confidence scoring, advanced comparison systems utilizing EXIF data and biodiversity tagging, and a robust citation and research attribution system with BibTeX export. Automated web scraping captures detailed botanical information from authoritative sources.
