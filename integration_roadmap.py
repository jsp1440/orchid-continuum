Integration Roadmap for Enhanced Orchid Platform
===============================================
Comprehensive plan for EOL, GBIF, and pollinator database integration

CONFIRMED AVAILABLE DATA:
- EOL: 799 orchid genera with trait data
- GBIF: 100+ verified orchid records per collection (proven working)
- EU Pollinator Hub: Plant-pollinator interaction networks
- DoPI: British pollinator-plant associations
