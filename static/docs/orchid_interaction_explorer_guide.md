- Displays observation density with color-coded heat maps
- Reveals geographic patterns and biodiversity hotspots

### 2. **üêù Pollinator Relationship Analysis**
- Identifies known pollinators for specific orchid species
- Shows pollination strategies (bee, fly, bird, wind, etc.)
- Reveals specialized pollinator-orchid partnerships
- Displays mimicry and deception strategies

### 3. **üçÑ Mycorrhizal Association Research**
- Maps fungal partnerships essential for orchid survival
- Shows which fungi species help orchids grow
- Reveals mycorrhizal networks in ecosystems
- Critical for orchid conservation understanding

### 4. **üé≠ Mimicry Strategy Documentation**
- Documents how orchids mimic other organisms
- Shows sexual deception strategies
- Reveals food deception mechanisms
- Displays Batesian and M√ºllerian mimicry examples

### 5. **üåø Traditional Uses & Applications**
- Historical human uses of orchid species
- Medicinal applications in traditional cultures
- Cultural significance and folklore
- Modern research applications

## üöÄ How to Use the Explorer

### **Step 1: Access the Tool**
Navigate to the Explorer through:
- Main menu ‚Üí **Browse & Discover** ‚Üí **Ecosystem Explorer**
- Direct URL: `/orchid-explorer`
- Or via the widget system for embedded use

### **Step 2: Search for a Species**
You have three ways to search:

#### **Option A: GBIF Taxon Key** (Most Precise)
- Enter a specific GBIF taxonomic key number
- Example: `2877955` for *Orchis mascula*
- This gives the most accurate and complete data

#### **Option B: Scientific Name**
- Type the Latin scientific name
- Example: `Orchis mascula` or `Disa uniflora`
- The system will find the best matching taxon

#### **Option C: Try the Examples**
Click the provided example links:
- **Monadenia (Disa)** - South African terrestrial orchids
- **Oberonia titania** - Tiny epiphytic orchids from Asia
- **Diuris aurea** - Australian golden orchids

### **Step 3: Explore the Results**

#### **Distribution Map**
- **Dark areas** = Higher observation density
- **Light areas** = Fewer recorded observations
- **Click and drag** to pan around the world
- **Scroll** to zoom in/out for detailed views

#### **Ecosystem Interactions Panel**
Review four key sections:
1. **Pollinators** - What insects/animals pollinate this orchid
2. **Mycorrhizal Fungi** - Essential fungal partnerships
3. **Mimicry Strategies** - How the orchid tricks pollinators
4. **Traditional Uses** - Historical human applications

#### **Data Sources & Attribution**
- Always check the bottom sections for data sources
- Links to original research papers and databases
- Proper academic attribution for citations
