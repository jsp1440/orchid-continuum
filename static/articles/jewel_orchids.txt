How to Keep Your Jewels Shining!

Cultural Information:

Caring for jewel orchids can be a breeze if you know the tricks. Here's a handy guide to help your green gems thrive:

Light: Bright, indirect light is your orchid's best friend. Direct sunlight? Not so much—it can scorch those beautiful leaves. Most jewel orchids prefer to grow in very low indirect light, making them perfect for low-light spots like offices or bathrooms.

Temperature: Aim for a cozy 60-80°F (16-27°C). Jewel orchids like to stay warm and toasty.

Humidity: These orchids adore high humidity levels (60-80%). A humidifier or humidity trays work wonders. Actually, other than Ludisia, most need consistent humidity and will benefit from being in a terrarium.

Watering: Keep the soil consistently moist, but avoid waterlogging. Water when the top inch of soil feels dry. These orchids definitely can't handle dryness for long—terrariums help maintain an evenly moist environment.

Media: Opt for a well-draining potting mix, like an orchid mix or a combo of bark, perlite, and sphagnum moss.

Fertilizing: Jewel orchids are light feeders. A balanced orchid fertilizer diluted to half strength every two weeks during the growing season will do the trick. Most need hardly any fertilizing.

Pro Tip: Terrariums are a jewel orchid's best friend! Even if it's just a jar, a terrarium can create the perfect microclimate, ensuring long-term growth and vitality.

So there you have it—the enchanting world of jewel orchids, where foliage reigns supreme, and every leaf tells a story. Ready to add some sparkle to your indoor garden? Jewel orchids are waiting to dazzle and delight!
