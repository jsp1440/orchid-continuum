Dr. Morgan Chen is the Research Director at the Environmental Science Institute, 
specializing in plant-soil interactions and educational technology. With a Ph.D. 
in Environmental Science focusing on computational biology, Dr. Chen leads innovative 
programs that engage students in real botanical research.

Dr. Chen founded the Botanical Research Collaborative to bridge the gap between 
university-level research and K-12 science education, believing that young minds 
can contribute meaningfully to solving environmental challenges through hands-on 
research experiences.

Current research focuses include mycorrhizal network mapping, soil health 
enhancement, and climate adaptation strategies in plant communities. Dr. Chen 
has mentored over 200 student researchers and co-authored 15 peer-reviewed 
publications with student collaborators.

"Every student has the potential to be a scientist. We just need to give them 
the tools, the data, and the belief that their work matters." - Dr. Morgan Chen
